                <p>Estimation of diagnostic test accuracy: 
                    A “Rule of Three” for data with repeated observations but without a gold standard. <br><br>
                    Stephen D. Walter <br><br>
                   
                    
                    Introduction. The problem of assessing the performance of diagnostic tests when there is no error-free (or gold standard) reference test available has previously been reviewed on a number of occasions. 
                        In particular, we have reviewed various scenarios where latent class models can be applied to this type of data, describing them in terms of the number of parameters involved, and the number of available degrees of freedom implied by the observational design. The main focus of much of that earlier work was on scenarios where different tests were applied to each patient, and it mostly dealt with binary test results.
                        In the current article, we consider the use of latent class models when there are repeated measures made by the same test method or observer, and where it is therefore reasonable to assume that the observations are exchangeable with respect to their diagnostic accuracy. In such cases, and in contrast to situations where different tests are used, the ordering of the observations is uninformative. When the same test is repeated, only the distribution of informative combinations of the test response is relevant to the evaluation of diagnostic performance. In this context, we here derive the requirements for the data such that suitable latent class models are identifiable, while allowing for tests to have an arbitrary number of outcome categories. Latent class modeling has enjoyed wide application to many areas of biomedical research where a gold standard is not available, including the assessment of X-ray and other body images by radiologists when biopsy or surgery is not feasible, evaluation of accuracy for cancer screening tests, the determination of causes of death in participants in cancer screening programs, examining differences between laboratory methods and between clinical centers in identifying genetic polymorphisms, diagnosis of various types of attention deficit disorders in children, differential psychiatric diagnosis, veterinary testing of animals for disease, and others.
                        Here we will illustrate the use of latent class models that involve repeated testing with the same observational method, using data from two clinical studies. We will demonstrate the options of assuming equal or unequal accuracy rates for the observations, of adopting a binary or multinomial representation of the response variable, and of potentially constraining the probabilities of certain types of test misclassification to be zero.

                    <p>
                        Methods
                        We will consider studies in which there are R observations made by the same test method, with each observation yielding a response variable having S possible categories, in a sample of n individuals. We will assume that there has been no change in the status of the individuals between the observations, and that identical measurement procedures are followed on each occasion; with these assumptions, it is reasonable to assume that the test has constant diagnostic accuracy for each of the observations on a given individual. Additionally, we will assume that the tests are independent of one another, both between individuals, and within individuals conditional on their true (but unknown) disease state; the latter assumption is sometimes referred to as local or conditional independence. The implications of potential departures from this assumption are described in Section 3.
                        As noted earlier, a gold standard (or reference) test is often unavailable, typically for reasons of cost, lack of suitable technology, or unacceptable invasiveness for the patient, and in such cases a common option is to adopt a latent class model in order to estimate the test’s accuracy. Latent class models formulate the likelihood of the observations on each individual as a function of the test accuracy parameters and the unknown (or latent) status of the individual being observed. Aggregating these likelihood contributions across a sample of patients yields a likelihood function for the entire data set, leading to maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters. The observational protocol (particularly, how many tests are used, and the number of categories for their results), combined with the assumed number of categories in the true latent state, tell us how many possible combinations of test outcomes there are for each patient, which in turn defines the number of degrees of freedom (df) associated with the data set.
                        The parameters of interest will, in the simplest cases, usually comprise the accuracy rates of the tests, and the underlying distribution of the latent state. We define γrst to represent the probability that an individual who is actually in state s is classified into an observed state t by test r. We also denote the probability distribution of true states by {θs: s = 1, 2, … S}. In addition to defining the diagnostic 
                        performance of a test and the prevalence of the various disease states in the sampled population, we may also derive associated quantities such as the predictive values. Predictive values are the probabilities that, given an observed test result (or set of results), the individual is actually in each of the true disease states. While misclassification error rates are useful in evaluating the accuracy of a test, the predictive values are more relevant to clinical decision-making, in terms of the actions that might be indicated by particular test results.
                    </p> <p>
                        If a test r is binary (with, say, S = 1 indicating a case of disease, and S = 2 indicating a non-case), test sensitivity is defined as the probability that an individual who truly has the attribute of interest (here, a case of disease) receives a correct positive test result, which is γr11; if not, the result is referred to as a false negative, which occurs with probability 1 − γr11 = γr12. The specificity of a binary test is the probability γr22 that a true non-case receives a correct negative test result, whose complement with probability 1 − γr22 = γr21 would be a false positive result. For tests with S > 2 possible response categories, and (if appropriate) assuming that the response categories have a natural order (eg, in terms of disease severity), we may extend these ideas, and similarly think of the model parameters as being a set of probabilities for false negative results (those where an individual receives a test result that is lower than his/her actual disease state), and vice versa for the false positive results. In cases where the response categories are not ordered, for example in the differential diagnosis of children between several different kinds of attention deficit disorders, or between a number of psychiatric disorders,  it is sufficient to simply refer to the parameters {γ} as a set of misclassification probabilities for one potential diagnosis to each of the others. 
                        For general values of R and S in the case of using replicated tests, we can characterize the model likelihood in terms of response profiles r = {r1, r2, … rS}, where rs is the number of classifications of an individual into state s. If ϕ(r) is the probability of observing the response profile r in a randomly chosen individual, the likelihood for the entire data set is given by
                        where n(r) is the number of individuals with observed response profiles r, and the product is over all possible profiles. Each profile uniquely corresponds to an ordered partition of R, as described earlier. The probability ϕ(r) is obtained using the multinomial distribution, as
                        fying the individual into category t, and is the probability of a single test result being in that category, aggregated over all possible true statesFor calculation purposes, the data could be collapsed into sets defined by the response profiles r, and then the likelihood defined by (3) could be used, or, more conveniently, the data can be arranged according to the observations on sampled individuals, with a specification of constraints on the parameters γrst = γst, for all combinations (r, s, t), thus defining that the R tests are replicates; this yields, in effect, likelihood (2). If these constraints are not applied, one reverts to the more general likelihood (1), in which the tests have potentially different misclassification probabilities.
                    </p> <p>    In the results above, we assumed that all R test observations were always made. An alternative diagnostic approach is to use sequential testing, whereby one continues testing up to some maximum number of binary tests until a person has a positive result, at which point the individual is classified as a case and testing stops. Otherwise, a full series of negative tests up to the maximum number will indicate a non-case.
                    
                        In particular, consider the usual case where just one positive result from a binary test is required to identify a case, and that a maximum of R tests will be administered to each person.
                        In this scenario, a case can potentially be declared after 1, 2, … R tests, with all negative tests up to that point. Also, there is only one way a non-case can be declared, which is to have all negative results up to and including the last test in the sequence. Hence there are a total of R + 1 possible response patterns for each individual, and hence R df. There are three parameters involved for a binary test, and hence the latent class model for sequential testing is identifiable if R ≥ 3, indicating that the Rule of Three applies once more, and so three rounds of testing are needed.
                    </p> <p> 
                        To develop the likelihood for the sequential testing scenario, we consider the possible test profiles of
                        an individual. First, if the ultimate result is a disease case declared after test k (k = 1, 2, … R), the final test must be positive and there must have been exactly k − 1 positive tests before that.  The probability of this sequence is , (k = 1, 2, …R), where the probabilities of a positive (case) or negative (non-case) result on a single test, respectively, with otherwise the same notation as previously. Second, if the ultimate result is a non-case, there must be a full sequence of R negative tests,  which occurs with probability. Hence the likelihood for an observed set of nk cases identified at test k (k = 1, 2, …R), and m non-cases, is
           Cauchy’s rigidity theorem <br><br>
                Martin Aigner, Günter M. Ziegler<br><br>
                    A famous result that depends on Euler’s formula is Cauchy’s rigidity theorem for 3-dimensional polyhedra. For the notions of congruence and of combinatorial equivalence that are used in the following we refer to the appendix on polytopes and polyhedra in the chapter on Hilbert’s third problem. 
                    Theorem
                </p> <p> 
                    If two 3-dimensional convex polyhedra P and P′ are combinatorially equivalent with corresponding facets being congruent, then also the angles between corresponding pairs of adjacent facets are equal (and thus P is congruent to P′). 
                    Proof
                    The following is essentially Cauchy’s original proof. Assume that two convex polyhedra P and P′ with congruent faces are given. We color the edges of P as follows: an edge is black (or “positive”) if the corresponding interior angle between the two adjacent facets is larger in P′ than in P; it is white (or “negative”) if the corresponding angle is smaller in P′ than in P. The black and the white edges of P together form a 2-colored plane graph on the surface of P, which by radial projection, assuming that the origin is in the interior of P, we may transfer to the surface of the unit sphere. If P and P′ have unequal corresponding facet-angles, then the graph is nonempty. With part (C) of the proposition in the previous chapter we find that there is a vertex p that is adjacent to at least one black or white edge, such that there are at most two changes between black and white edges (in cyclic order). Now we intersect P with a small sphere Sε (of radius ε) centered at the vertex p, and we intersect P′ with a sphere S′ε of the same radius ε centered at the corresponding vertex p′. In Sε and S′ε we find convex spherical polygons Q and Q′ such that corresponding arcs have the same lengths, because of the congruence of the facets of P and P′, and since we have chosen the same radius ε.
                    Now we mark by + the angles of Q for which the corresponding angle
                    in Q′ is larger, and by − the angles whose corresponding angle of Q′
                </p> <p> is smaller. That is, when moving from Q to Q′ the + angles are “opened,” the − angles are “closed,” while all side lengths and the unmarked angles stay constant.  
                    From our choice of p we know that some + or − sign occurs, and that in
                    cyclic order there are at most two +/− changes. If only one type of signs occurs, then the lemma below directly gives a contradiction, saying that one edge must change its length. If both types of signs occur, then (since there are only two sign changes) there is a “separ tion line” that connects the midpoints of two edges and separates all the + signs from all the − signs.  Again we get a contradiction from the lemma below, since the separation line cannot be both longer and shorter in Q′ than in Q.
                    Cauchy’s arm lemma
                    If Q and Q′ are convex (planar or spherical) n-gons,  such that qi qi+1 = q′iq′i+1 holds for the lengths of corresponding edges for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and αi ≤ α′i holds for the sizes of corresponding angles for 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, then the “missing” edge length satisfies q1qn ≤ q′1q′n with equality if and only if αi = α′i holds for all i. It is interesting that Cauchy’s original proof of the lemma was false: a continuous motion that opens angles and keeps side-lengths fixed may destroy convexity. On the other hand, both the lemma and its proof given here, from a letter by I. J. Schoenberg to S. K. Zaremba, are valid both for planar and for spherical polygons.  
                </p> <p>  Proof 
                    We use induction on n. The case n = 3 is easy: If in a triangle we increase the angle γ between two sides of fixed lengths a and b, then the length c of the opposite side also increases. Analytically, this follows from the cosine theorem c2 = a2 + b2 − 2ab cos γ in the planar case, and from the analogous result cos c = cos a cos b + sin a sin b cos γ in spherical trigonometry. Here the lengths a, b, c are measured on the surface of a sphere of radius 1, and thus have values in the interval [0, π].
                    Now let n ≥ 4. If for any i E {2,...,n − 1} we have αi = α′i, then the corresponding vertex can be cut off by introducing the diagonal from qi−1 to qi+1 resp. from q′i−1to q′i+1, with qi−1qi+1 = q′i−1q′i+1, so we are done by induction. Thus we may assume αi < α′i for 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Now we produce a new polygon Q* from Q by replacing αn−1 by the largest possible angle α*n−1 ≤ α′n−1 that keeps Q* convex. For this we replace qn by q*n, keeping all the other qi, edge lengths, and angles from Q. If indeed we can choose α*n−1 = α′n−1 keeping Q* convex, then we get q1qn < q1q*n ≤ q′1q′n, using the case n = 3 for the first step and induction as above for the second. Otherwise after a nontrivial move that yields q1q*n > q1qn we “get stuck” in a situation where q2, q1 and q*n are collinear, with q2q1 + q1q*n = q2q*n. Now we compare this Q* with Q′ and find q2q*n ≤ q′2q′n by induction on n (ignoring the vertex q1resp. q′1). Thus we obtain q′1q′n≥ q′2q′n − q′1q′2≥ q2q*n − q1q2= q1q*n> q1qn,
                    where (*) is just the triangle inequality, and all other relations have already been derived.
                    We have seen an example which shows that Cauchy’s theorem is not truefor nonconvex polyhedra. The special feature of this example is, of course,that a noncontinuous “flip” takes one polyhedron to the other, keeping the facets congruent while the dihedral angles “jump.” One can ask for more: Could there be, for some nonconvex polyhedron, a continuous deformation that would keep the facets flat and congruent?
                </p> <p>  It was conjectured that no triangulated surface, convex or not, admits sucha motion. So, it was quite a surprise when in 1977 — more than 160 years after Cauchy’s work — Robert Connelly presented counter examples: closed triangulated spheres embedded in R3 (without self-intersections) that are flexible, with a continuous motion that keeps all the edge lengths constant, and thus keeps the triangular faces congruent.
                    The rigidity theory of surfaces has even more surprises in store: Idjad
                    Sabitov managed to prove that when any such flexing surface moves, thevolume it encloses must be constant. His proof is beautiful also in its use of the algebraic machinery of polynomials and determinants (outside the scope of this book).
                </p> <p> Quarks <br><br>
                Carl Rod Nave, Georgia State University<br><br>
           Quarks and Leptons are the building blocks which build up matter, i.e., they are seen as the “elementary particles”. In the present standard model, there are six “flavors” of quarks. They can successfully account for all known mesons and baryons (over 200). The most familiar baryons are the proton and neutron, which are each constructed from up and down quarks. Quarks are observed to occur only in combinations of two quarks (mesons), three quarks (baryons). There was a recent claim of observation of particles with five quarks (pentaquark), but further experimentation has not borne it out.
                    The masses should not be taken too seriously, because the confinement of quarks implies that we cannot isolate them to measure their masses in a direct way. The masses must be implied indirectly from scattering experiments.
                    The numbers in the table are very different from numbers previously quoted and are based on the July 2010 summary in Journal of Physics G, Review of Particle Physics, Particle Data Group. A summary can be found on the LBL site. These masses represent a strong departure from earlier approaches which treated the masses for the U and D as about 1/3 the mass of a proton, since in the quark model the proton has three quarks. The masses quoted are model dependent, and the mass of the bottom quark is quoted for two different models. But in other combinations they contribute different masses. In the pion, an up and an anti-down quark yield a particle of only 139.6 MeV of mass energy, while in the rho vector meson the same combination of quarks has a mass of 770 MeV! 
                </p> <p> The masses of C and S are from Serway, and the T and B masses are from descriptions of the experiments in which they were discovered.
                    Each of the six “flavors” of quarks can have three different “colors”. The quark forces are attractive only in “colorless” combinations of three quarks (baryons), quark-antiquark pairs (mesons) and possibly larger combinations such as the pentaquark that could also meet the colorless condition. Quarks undergo transformations by the exchange of W bosons, and those transformations determine the rate and nature of the decay of hadrons by the weak interaction. The name “quark” was taken by Murray Gell-Mann from the book “Finnegan’s Wake”
                    by James Joyce. The line “Three quarks for Muster Mark...” appears in the fanciful book. Gell-Mann received the 1969 Nobel Prize for his work in classifying elementary particles.
                    Up and Down Quarks
                    The up and down quarks are the most common and least massive quarks, being the constituents of protons and neutrons and thus of most ordinary matter. 
                    The fact that the free neutron decays  and nuclei decay by beta decay is thought to be the result of a more fundamental quark process
                            The Strange Quark
                        </p> <p>        In 1947 during a study of cosmic ray interactions, a product of a proton collision with a nucleus was found to live for a much longer time than expected: 10-10 seconds instead of the expected 10-23 seconds! This particle was named the lambda particle (Λ0) and the property which caused it to live so long was dubbed “strangeness” and that name stuck to be the name of one of the quarks from which the lambda particle is constructed. The lambda is a baryon which is made up of three quarks: an up, a down and a strange quark.
                            
                            The shorter lifetime of 10-23 seconds was expected because the lambda as a baryon participates in the strong interaction, and that usually leads to such very short lifetimes. The long observed lifetime helped develop a new conservation law for such decays called the “conservation of strangeness”. The presence of a strange quark in a particle is denoted by a quantum number S=-1. Particle decay by the strong or electromagnetic interactions preserve the strangeness quantum number. The decay process for the lambda particle must violate that rule, since there is no lighter particle which contains a strange quark - so the strange quark must be transformed to another quark in the process. That can only occur by the weak interaction, and that leads to a much longer lifetime. The decay processes show that strangeness is not conserved:
                            The quark transformations necessary to accomplish these decay processes can be visualized with the help of Feynman diagrams. The omega-minus, a baryon composed of three strange quarks, is a classic example of the need for the property called “color” in describing particles. Since quarks are fermions with spin 1/2, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle and cannot exist in identical states. So with three strange quarks, the property which distinguishes them must be capable of at least three distinct values. Conservation of strangeness is not in fact an independent conservation law, but can be viewed as a combination of the conservation of charge, isospin, and baryon number. It is often expressed in terms of hypercharge Y, defined by:
                            Where S = Strangeness, B = Baryon number, Q = Electric charge, and I = Isopspin. Isospin and either hypercharge or strangeness are the quantum numbers often used to draw particle diagrams for the hadrons.
                            
                            The Charm Quark
                            In 1974 a meson called the J/Psi particle was discovered by experimenters at Stanford (Richter) and Brookhaven National Laboratory (Ting). With a mass of 3100 MeV, over three times that of the proton, this particle was the first example of another quark, called the charm quark. The J/Psi is made up of a charm-anticharm quark pair. Richter and Ting shared the 1976 Nobel Prize for their discovery.
                            
                        </p> <p>  The lightest meson which contains a charm quark is the D meson. It provides interesting examples of decay since the charm quark must be transformed into a strange quark by the weak interaction in order for it to decay. One baryon with a charm quark is a called a lambda with symbol Λ+c. It has a composition udc and a mass 
                            of 2281 MeV/c2. 
                            
                            The Top Quark
                            Convincing evidence for the observation of the top quark was reported by Fermilab ‘s Tevatron facility in April 1995. The evidence was found in the collision products of 0.9 TeV protons with equally energetic antiprotons in the proton-antiproton collider. The evidence involved analysis of trillions of 1.8 TeV proton-antiproton collisions. The Collider Detector Facility group had found 56 top candidates over a predicted background of 23
                             and the D0 group found 17 events over a predicted background of 3.8. The value for the top quark mass from the combined data of the two groups after the completion of the run was 174.3 +/- 5.1 GeV. This is over 180 times the mass of a proton and about twice the mass of the next heaviest fundamental particle, the Z0 vector boson at about 93 GeV.  The interaction is envisioned as follows:
                            </p> <p>    Confinement of Quarks
                            How can one be so confident of the quark model when no one has ever seen an isolated quark? There are good reasons for the lack of direct observation. Apparently the color force does not drop off with distance like the other observed forces. It is postulated that it may actually increase with distance at the rate of about 1 GeV
                            per fermi. A free quark is not observed because by the time the separation is on an observable scale, the energy is far above the pair production energy for quark-antiquark pairs. For the U and D quarks the masses are 10s of MeV so pair production would occur for distances much less than a fermi. You would expect a lot of mesons (quark-antiquark pairs) in very high energy collision experiments and that is what is observed.
                            
                        </p> <p>    Basically, you can’t see an isolated quark because the color force does not let them go, and the energy required to separate them produces quark-antiquark pairs long before they are far enough apart to observe separately.
                            
                            One kind of visualization of quark confinement is called the “bag model”. One visualizes the quarks as contained in an elastic bag which allows the quarks to move freely around, as long as you don’t try to pull them further apart. But if you try to pull a quark 
                            out, the bag stretches and resists. Another way of looking at quark confinement is expressed by Rohlf. “When we try to pull a quark out of a proton, for example by striking the quark with another energetic particle, the quark experiences a potential energy barrier from the strong interaction that increases with distance.” As the example of alpha decay demonstrates, having a barrier higher than the particle energy does not prevent the escape of the particle - quantum mechanical tunneling gives a finite probability for a 6 MeV alpha particle to get through a 30 MeV high energy barrier. But the energy barrier for the alpha particle is thin enough for tunneling to be effective. In the case of the barrier facing the quark, the energy barrier does not drop off with distance, but in fact increases.
                        The Bottom Quark
                        In 1977, an experimental group at Fermilab led by Leon Lederman discovered a new resonance at 9.4 GeV/c2 which was interpreted as a bottom-antibottom quark pair and called the Upsilon meson. From this experiment, the mass of the bottom quark is implied to be about 5 GeV/c2. The reaction being studied was
                    </p> <p>  where N was a copper or platinum nucleus. The spectrometer had a muon-pair mass resolution of about 2%, which allowed them to measure an excess of events at 9.4 GeV/c2. This resonance has been subsequently studied at other accelerators with a detailed investigation of the bound states of the bottom-antibottom meson. Studies of the B-meson have also been productive. These studied resulted in the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics to Kobayashi and Maskawa for their explanaton of CP-violation. Further studies of CP-violation have been made in the LHCb Experiment at the LHC which studies interactions of hadrons containing the b-quark.

                    The Significance of Three: A Common Theme Across All Religions <br> <br>
                    Universal Enlightenment and Flourishing <br><br>
             Past, present, future; length, width, height; small, medium, large — there are many groupings of 3 that we’ve used throughout human history to describe and organize the world around us.

                    Across all religions, many of the most important theological concepts are expressed as groupings of 3. One of the most obvious examples of this is the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, which most — though not all — branches of Christianity believe in.
                    The Holy Trinity refers to the belief that God, though One, is manifested in 3 forms: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit. The 3 forms coexist as distinct from one another, but each one is understood as God.
                 There are many other 3s in Christianity as well: the 3 wise men who came to witness the birth of Jesus, the 3 days between Jesus’ death and resurrection, and the 3 Abrahamic Patriarchs, recognized by Judaism and Islam as well: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
                    There are 3 Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. And the religions of Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism are all subdivided into 3 major sects.
                    Three main sects of Christianity are Catholicism, Protestantism, and Orthodox; Sunni, Shia, and Sufi are the 3 for Islam; Buddhism is also split into 3: Mahayana, Theravada, and Vajrayana; Hinduism has countless sects, but the largest 3 are Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism. Hindus also believe in 3 primary gods, which are all manifestations of God, somewhat similar to the Christian Trinity: Brahma, the creator, Vishnu, the nurturer, and Shiva (also known as Mahesh), the destroyer.
                    Hinduism abounds with groupings of 3. Some others include “Sat, Chit, Annand” (truth, consciousness, bliss), the 3-part description of Brahman, the ultimate reality; the 3 core values of Satyam, Shivum, Sundaram (truth, godliness, beauty); and the 3 “gunas,” qualities that are present in every individual in different proportions: sattva (goodness, calmness, harmonious), rajas (passion, activity, movement), and tamas (ignorance, inertia, laziness).
                    The number 3 features so prominently in the psyche of Indians that the richest Indian when choosing a number (phone, car, bids) will only choose the numbers that are divisible by three.
                    Many religions represent beliefs and principles relating to conduct in groupings of 3 as well. There are 3 Taoist Treasures: compassion, simplicity, and humility. In his Analects, Confucius designates many similar groupings of 3 core principles of conduct. In Jainism, there are 3 Jewels: samyagdarshana (“right faith”), samyagjnana (“right knowledge”), and samyakcharitra (“right conduct”).
                    Buddhists affirm their faith through the following trio of statements: I take refuge in the Buddha. I take refuge in the Dharma (the teachings). I take refuge in the Sangha (the monastic community). These are known as the 3 Jewels of Buddhism. The 3 Baskets of Buddhism refer to the groupings of the original Buddhist texts.
                    The beloved Hindu text, the Bhagavad Gita, discusses many concepts of 3s, most notably the 3 yogas, or paths to enlightenment: Bhakti Yoga (the path of devotion), Jnana Yoga (the path of knowledge), and Karma Yoga (the path of action).
                </p> <p>   These 3 paths also correspond closely to UEF’s fundamental trio of human flourishing — love, learning, and play — which UEF believes to be the ONLY deepest longings of us humans.
                    There is something very special about the number 3!
                    One way for accounting for the prevalence of the number 3, which has been proposed by psychologists and cognitive scientists, is that 3 is right around the number of discreet pieces of information we can hold in our minds at once. “For example, when we present phone numbers, we present them in groups of three and four, which helps us to remember the list,” says psychologist Nelson Cowan. Perhaps this is also why the authors of religious scriptures chose to represent the most important aspects of their teachings in groupings of 3.
                    Another way to understand groupings of 3s is from the perspective of harmony: the triangle is the strongest basic shape and the many trichotomies we see are like perfectly balanced triangles. The German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel famously described the tripartite dialectic of thesis, antithesis, synthesis, in which the contradictions between a thing and its opposite are resolved, giving birth to a new third thing. Plato spoke of the tripartite human, composed of nous (mind), soma (body), and soul (psyche), a trichotomy that many people still believe describes humanity well. Similarly, Sigmund Freud’s famous theory of mind was a tripartite one: the human mind is composed of 3 parts — id, ego, and superego. The ego is the mediator between the two extremes of the id (our primal drives) and the superego (our sense of morality and restraint).
                    Hinduism “Om Tat Sat: these three words represent Brahman, from which come priests and scriptures and sacrifice. Those who follow the Vedas, therefore, always repeat the word Om when offering sacrifices, performing spiritual disciplines, or giving gifts.” — The Bhagavad Gita (17:23–24) Islam
                    “Perhaps no other theme of the mosque lessons better captures the Aristotelian principle of ethical formation than that of the classical triad of fear (al-khauf), hope (al-raja’), and love (al-hubb).”
                    — Saba Mahmood, scholar of Islam
                </p> <p>  Confucianism
                    “There are three things constantly on the lips of the gentleman none of which I have succeeded in following: ‘A man of benevolence never worries; a man of wisdom is never in two minds; a man of courage is never afraid.’”
                    — The Analects (14:28) Christianity
                    “For there are three that testify: the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement.”
                    — The New Testament (1 John 5:7–8). Buddhism
                    “Om is composed of three letters, 
                    A, U, and M. These symbolize the practitioner’s impure body, speech, and mind; they also symbolize the pure exalted body, speech, and mind of a Buddha.”
                    — The Dalai Lama, Buddhist spiritual leader. Baha’i
                    “For the intention, the power and the action, all the three essential elements are brought together and the realization of everything in the contingent world dependeth upon these three principles.”
                    — ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Baha’i leader

                    Does ‘3’ hold special significance in Christianity? <br><br>
                    The Kansas City Star <br><br>

The Rev. Penny Ellwood, Blue Springs campus pastor, United Methodist Church of the Resurrection: We have a human habit of looking for patterns of three. You hear people say all the time expressions like “three’s company” or conversely, “three’s a crowd” or “the third time’s the charm, “or “bad news always comes in threes.” I’m not sure where our habit of thinking that way 
</p> <p> originated, but when one goes looking for threes, you can certainly find them 
in Christianity as well.

The use of the number three is abundant in the Bible. Noah had three sons (Gen. 6:10). Three visitors appeared to Abraham (Genesis 18:2). Jonah was inside the belly of the fish three days and nights (Jonah 1:17). Jesus answered Satan’s threefold temptations with three scriptural references (Matthew 4:1-11). Jesus’ ministry lasted three years. Peter denied Jesus three times (Luke 22:54-62), and three times Jesus affirmed his love (John 21:15-17). There are many references to three, but nothing quite as important as the climax of our faith and Jesus’ redemptive work, his resurrection on the third day (Luke 24:7). 

No doubt the biblical authors often employed the number or wrote in patterns of three to provide a special emphasis or a clue that there was more than meets the eye in the events recorded.

</p> <p> Christians also see three as symbolic of the Trinity, the triune nature of God: as Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Three distinct persons who share one divine nature and have existed eternally in community with one another. This threefold relationship forms the basis of the community and relationship we are called to live as Christians. Our task as Christians is to express, transform and extend our world, in accordance with the pattern revealed in the mystery of the Trinity.

In our church, we believe this happens in another threefold — the use of our head, heart and hands. We study and learn to know who God is with our heads. We engage in relationships of love with our hearts, and we serve with our hands to reshape and build God’s kingdom with the hope of complete and full restoration someday. These are but a few of the threes found in our faith. So I guess you might say that three is something of a holy number.

The Rev. Jeff Palmer: The quantity of three does hold significant value in the Christian faith, particularly in the context of the Bible narrative. Just to name a few of many examples: There are three persons in the trinity of God — the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ) and the Holy Spirit. There are three main patriarchs in the Old Testament — Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Jesus’ ministry on Earth lasted three years. The apostle Peter denied knowing Jesus three times following the evening of his arrest. Jesus was resurrected from the grave three days after his death and burial.

</p> <p> So why is the quantity of three significant? The number three biblically represents divine wholeness, completeness and perfection. If ever there were a desire to highlight an idea, thought, event or noteworthy figure in the Bible for their prominence, the number three was used to put a divine stamp of completion or fulfillment on the subject. Although there is great biblical meaning to the use of the number within its context, we should avoid applying the same biblical application of the number outside of the text. For example, observing that “bad things in life always happen in threes” is merely an observation of coincidence, not a reflection of completeness as noted in the Bible.

Furthermore, the number three should merely be held as a significant number within the Christian faith rather than a holy number. An item that is deemed holy is something dedicated or set apart for God. The number does not fit the category of holiness, but neither should it be overlooked in its biblical importance.

 Three Realms of Existence <br><br>
 Samye Institute <br><br>

</p> <p> existence are the various states in which sentient beings take rebirth. According to the Buddha, these three realms constitute saṃsāra. 

In Buddhist cosmology, saṃsāra, or cyclic existence, contains three realms. The Buddhist classification differs from earlier Indian cosmology, which described the three spheres of heaven, earth, and hell (or underworld). According to the Buddha’s presentation, these realms are not external states but rather mental projections. These three states/realms are: The desire realm (Skt. kāmadhātu; Tib. dö kham),  rhe form realm (Skt. rūpadhātu; Tib. zuk kham), and  the formless realm (Skt. arūpadhātu; Tib. zuk mé kham).

In The Application of Mindfulness of the Sacred Dharma, found within the Hinayana section of the Tibetan Dege Kangyur,1 Buddha Sakyamuni taught that sentient beings take rebirth in these three realms based on their karma. The Buddha said:

Birth in the three realms
</p> <p> Is appropriated by three types of mind
 and the product of three flaws
That thus ripen in three places.
As causes and conditions come together,
Distinct karmic formations appear.
</p> <p> The ripening of karmic actions
Appears as the three realms.

Transformations occur
In accordance with the character of the mind.
Thus, virtue engenders virtue
And evil begets evil.
Karmic action is associated with the mind
</p> <p> And the result with the karmic action.
Thus instigated by the mind and karmic action,
This is known as cyclic existence.

Desire Realm
The desire realm takes its name from the fact that sentient beings living here are subject to strong emotions and have strong desires and cravings for sense pleasures. There are six classes of sentient beings in the desire realm as follows:

1. Hell beings
2. Pretas (starving spirits)
</p> <p> 3. Animals
4. Humans
5. Asuras (demigods)
6. Desire realm gods

Within the desire realm, there are six separate states of existence known as celestial paradises or heavens that are inhabited by gods. Those who are reborn here enjoy long life spans in very pleasureable conditions. Although traditional Indian cosmology refers to them as gods or deities, they are not creator gods.
Form and Formless Realms
Sentient beings who inhabit the form and formless (or immaterial) realms are also usually referred to as gods. Sentient beings take rebirth in one of these heavens based upon the virtuous karma that they accumulated through the practice of one of the four causal meditative states, or dhyānas. These dhyānas should be understood as states of existence rather than as places, even though they are described as realms. 

The form realm contains 17 separate heavenly states of existence, and sentient beings take rebirth depending upon their mastery of particular dhyānas. The formless realm comprises four realms and is inhabited by gods without bodily form, who rest in four states of absorption. It is said that because they do not possess form, they are unable to hear the Dharma. One attains rebirth there by passing away while in the meditative absorption of one of the four formless states

In The Application of Mindfulness of the Sacred Dharma sutra, the Buddha repeatedly drew attention to the fact that the mind creates the experience. This applies equally to the highest and lowest forms of existence. In the fourth chapter of this sutra, it states:


Gods, asuras, piśācas, nāgas,
</p> <p> Mahoragas, and rākṣasas
All have a single lord, the mind.
This is the king of the three 
realms of existence.
Mind leads to heaven
And to the realm of humans.


Mind also leads to the lower realms,
Making people roam aimlessly.
The mind that is confused 
and impaired
</p> <p> By all its useless objects
Is driven by craving,
And confined to infinite pain.

                Guided by the Grid: Raising Attention with the Rule of Thirds <br><br>
                Michael Koliska & Klive (Soo-Kwang) Oh<br><br>
                Introduction
            </p> <p> The rule of thirds (RoT), in art and photography, refers to making use of the intersections of four imaginary lines that divide an image into thirds, horizontally and vertically, to alter the composition of an image. Although many people may not be aware of the term “rule of thirds,” they may very well apply it on a daily basis when taking pictures with their mobile devices. Digital cameras and camera apps normally have a RoT grid option to assist the user in taking a photograph. Most photo editing software also provide a RoT layer to guide the cropping process of a picture. Virtually any book on learning photography will discuss the RoT. One of the goals of employing the RoT is to compose an aesthetically pleasing and balanced image composition but also to position the most important information within the image in such a way as to communicate it saliently, thereby increasing the probability of a more accurate identification
of the most important information of an image. 

The RoT as a guiding principle of image composition and image perception
is especially relevant in the digital news media environment, with its increasing emphasis on visual culture. Visual news has been predicted to be replacing text-based news as the main source of information. Photos and videos are and continue to be important in the online communication economy on social media as well as in political communication and participation. In fact, news consumers increasingly share and consume visual information. For instance, over the past few years, the consumption of online news videos alone doubled across several countries in the Americas and Europe.

The proliferation of visual information has a number of implications for the production and perception of visual news content. On the one hand, the demand for images as an essential tool for journalistic storytelling created a demand for multimedia skills to produce professional high-quality visual content. Students in video and photography classes, including in the U.S., 
where this study was conducted, learn using RoT in order to improve the composition of an image (while abiding by journalistic principles and ethics). Possessing such a skill has been deemed to be one of the differences between visual content produced by professional journalists and amateurs.

</p> <p> On the other hand, a shift toward more visual content may impact the way users, readers, and audiences perceive information and news. Scholars speak of a visual primacy effect that highlights the salience of visual cues over verbal ones. Empirical research shows that visual cues can overshadow textual information or carry biases such as in political news coverage, environmental news, conflict coverage, but also on social media. People have the tendency—at least on Facebook—to form impressions about others primarily based on their profile photos, rather than on the verbal self-disclosures that accompany these images.

The proliferation of visual information and the dominance of visual over textual information, as described by the visual primacy effect, indicate the need to improve the creation of visual information such as photographs. The RoT may be able to assist in this process by making the focus point of an image more salient and thus reducing the probability of information processing errors. Yet, despite the ubiquity of visual content and wide use of the RoT as a decision-making tool for composition, research has not expansively explored the effectiveness of the RoT as a way to guide attention within visual communication. This exploratory study attempts to fill this gap in research by theorizing and testing the RoT as a geometrical structure that assists the processing of visual information.

Literature Review
The Rule of Thirds: Practice and Theory
Since the fifteenth century, artists have been using the Rule of Thirds (RoT) to make certain crucial parts of an image more salient. Specifically, the RoT is used to determine areas of interest that lie at the four intersections of imaginary lines drawn to divide the composition into thirds, both horizontally and vertically.

Many visual artists and photo professionals maintain that composition rules guide attention effectively and produce desired effects in most circumstances. The main subject is often placed off-center, at one of the intersections of the thirds, to avoid static effects. The RoT helps balance and structure the different elements of an image by establishing visual priorities among lines, shapes, colors, and textures, and it helps orchestrate viewer eye movement, encouraging exploration of the entire photograph.

Although users of the RoT frequently accept these principles, little research has been done to test them. Some scholars suggest that artistic practices have merit and can serve as a good starting point for exploratory research. They argue that artists often recognize key visual principles before psychologists, acknowledging that the visual image results from the observer’s active perceptual activity.

</p> <p> Evidence shows that artistic rules can produce measurable effects. For instance, using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), one study found that the golden ratio produced the “desired effects.” Subjects exposed to a Greek statue in its original canonical form experienced strong feelings of beauty, while subjects viewing the same sculpture with altered proportions rated it as ugly, with the fMRI results supporting these subjective evaluations.
Despite the RoT’s widespread use, relatively little research has explored its effects. Some studies have shown that the centrality of an image produces higher emotional intensity and valence, though they didn’t directly test if RoT composition or geometrical alignment produces such effects. Other research examined the detection of RoT presence as a marker of image aesthetics, quality, and object salience. Computer models have been found to approximate human perceptions of RoT images, though some studies suggest RoT may only play a minor role in aesthetic evaluations.

Few studies have convincingly theorized why RoT may be an effective compositional rule or shown clear connections to human perceptions. Little research has tested whether RoT assists in human information processing by making central information more salient.

This study argues that RoT composition will guide attention and ease the processing of primary visual content. Specifically, the RoT raises attention to the main subject, conveys crucial information through positioning, and enhances engagement through a higher perceived valence. In this way, RoT reduces the complexity of visual information by placing content within a geometrical structure that aligns with the human visual system.

Vision: A System to Reduce Complexity
The human visual system enables us to see, comprehend, and make sense of our surroundings. It is considered more effective and faster at processing audio-visual than verbal information. The visual system can stimulate behavior before the conscious mind becomes aware of it, and it is superior in processing complex information quickly. One glance at a complex visual scene can convey more information than words would, with greater fidelity. Research indicates that the visual system evolved as a tool for managing information and social complexity, supporting higher-order thinking and processing nuanced social information.

</p> <p> Although the visual system can handle complex sets of information, the absence of explicit guidelines, like syntactical and lexical rules in visual communication, complicates the transfer of exact information through images and videos. Neuroscientists and psychologists have shown that human vision operates by reducing complexity. For example, perception theory builds on the idea that the eyes are a direct extension of the brain into the environment. Perception is a complex process, driven largely by the unconscious emotional system, which helps us derive meaning from what we see.

Visual cognition suggests that behavior, learning, and knowledge are direct responses to visual input. This process allows us to recognize shapes, objects, and scenes based on retinal input. Research on visual cognition focuses on the recognition of shapes and surfaces and how they are remembered or recalled. Geometrical shapes, surfaces, and redundancy are key elements in easing and speeding up the processing of visual input, and aesthetics also play a role in memory retention, as “good” figures are more likely to be remembered than “poor” ones.

</p> <p> However, visual information processing can be complicated by certain factors. Eye movements, which occur every 200 milliseconds, limit the visual system’s ability to store information for long periods. Perception can also be influenced by forward or backward masking, where one visual stimulus interferes with another. Additionally, emotions can bias visual perception. Given these cognitive limitations, a selection process must focus on the most crucial visual information for effective vision. Research shows that geometrical structures, such as those found in the Rule of Thirds (RoT) grid, can assist in this selection process by aligning content and guiding attention.

Attention, a Guiding Principle for Vision
Researchers describe attention as a type of selection process distinguishing relevant from irrelevant stimuli, which is required to process visual information. Tipper and Weaver suggest that the visual system relies on attention; without it, objects cannot be processed, nor recognized. Pylyshyn stresses the importance of the “focal attention as an interface between vision and cognition.” Attention, in other words, enhances specific spatial points or areas, which define or constitute particular objects. Specifically, attention heightens but also diminishes aspects of perception. Thus, attention operates like a filtering system that includes and excludes visual categories from the focus of awareness. Pylyshyn argues that the filtering process exists to prevent overloading of the visual system and to reduce interference on perception and cognition.

Several researchers have suggested that attention is guided by specific patterns and symmetries of geometrical shapes that facilitate information processing. Uttal posits that “human visual systems are symmetry information-processing systems.” In other words, specific layouts of a scene or surface representations, that highlight the edges of surfaces, induce attention, making perception possible. Pylyshyn describes visual analysis or vision as
“a highly complex informationprocessing system [that] individuates, or picks out, objects in a scene and computes the spatial layout of visible surfaces and the 3D shapes of the objects in the scene.”

Marr conceptualizes the complexity of the visual process and cognition by defining vision from the user-centered perspective. His model, which converges the concepts of vision, attention and an even-spaced grid, specifically evokes the idea that the RoT may mimic the function of the human visual system on a rudimentary level. Marr describes vision as “a process that produces from images of the external world a description that is useful to the viewer and not cluttered with irrelevant information.” Marr’s model stresses that the filtering of information is achieved through geometrical structures that raise attention and accelerate the processing of the filtered visual information. Marr speaks of three different levels of analysis within the visual process, which all utilize geometrical structures akin to a coordinate system or a grid. The “primal sketch” provides important information about the two-dimensional sphere by detecting intensity changes and a geometrical distribution. The “2 ½-D sketch” highlights spatial relationships within a viewer centered coordinate frame. The last stage is the “3-D model representation” which changes the frame to an object centered coordinate frame to “describe shapes and their spatial organization.”

While scholars point out that perception is not governed by specific laws, they agree on an underlying mechanism of attention, i.e., filtering visual information on the basis of geometrical structures that are spatially aligned. Attention can then be described as a process, which is guided by symmetry and geometrical structures that assist in the filtering of information and contribute to the ease of information processing within the complexity of visual cognition. The idea of the RoT as a geometrical structure that guides attention may then have merit. As a compositional tool RoT assists human vision by placing visual content on a grid, guiding the observer’s attention toward the most crucial visual information of an image. Thus, allowing for an easier, faster and less error prone processing of visual content. Following the rationale of these theoretical underpinnings, images that follow the RoT should make the focus of interest more accessible and easier to be understood. Thus, also making, among other aspects, the message and valence of an image more salient. Research shows that attention is closely connected to valence, which has been described as a form of cognition. Valence perceptions can thus be considered as an expression of information processing, reflecting a level of attention or how salient the main message of an image may be. We posit that measuring and comparing valence perceptions of images that are compliant and noncompliant with the RoT can thus indicate how the RoT aides image information processing.

</p> <p> In summary, on the basis of these theoretical propositions, we posit that the RoT manipulates the visual structure of an image to raise attention, facilitating an easier visual analysis and understanding of a photograph. In order to examine this proposition, this study explores two research questions, which were deemed appropriate for this first-time research inquiry synthesizing and exploring these concepts. First, research has often argued that one of the critical aspects of understanding the narrative of an image is to perceive the valence (positive or negative) of the image as a form of information processing. Therefore, we explore whether ratings of the perceived valence of images are significantly affected by the compliance with the RoT.

RQ1. Does the rule of thirds have a significant effect on the perceived valence of images?

Another important aspect of image production is to place the main subject or focus of interest in such a way that it draws attention to the central information conveyed by the image. The literature on vision suggests that the RoT would help raise attention to the main subject of an image, which is arguably the starting point for perceiving the main information or narrative of an image. Thus, we sought to explore the 
relationship between the perceived main subject of the image and compliance with the RoT.

RQ2. Does the rule of thirds have a significant effect on the perceived main subject of images?

Methodology
Design
In this experimental exploratory study, we employed a within-subjects 2 (valence type) × 2 (rule of thirds composition) × 2 (rule of thirds main subject) repeated-measures design. “Valence type” refers to the positive or negative (two levels) types of emotions of an image; “rule of thirds composition” indicates whether an image composition was in compliance with the RoT (two levels: “yes” and “no”); and the “rule of thirds main subject” referred to whether the main subject of the image was situated on one of the four RoT grid intersections (two levels: “yes” and “no”).

Employing the repeated-measures design to test “perceived valence” and “perceived main subject of image” ensured stronger statistical power while also being economical, requiring fewer participants. The repeated measures design also made sense as the level of variability between participants across all images (that contain different characteristics of the independent variables) was low and the design allowed for a higher number of respondents to produce a given number of observations in contrast to other experimental designs that only match participants to one image or independent variable. Thus, due to the nature of the within-subjects experiment design the sample size was deemed appropriate. The 41 participants completing the study were each exposed to 24 different news images in random order (see below), making the total n = 984 for the experiment. For this research design, power analysis indicated that a total sample of 34 participants would be needed to detect large effects (d = .8) with 90% power using a t-test (with alpha at .05).

Sample Population
A total of 52 undergraduate students majoring in journalism were recruited from a large mid-Atlantic university in the United States via in-class announcements. Participants were told they would view images and answer a short set of questions for each image. In the recruitment phase, participants were also informed of the potentially graphic nature of some images based on the topics being portrayed and were given the option to decline participation. Under the instructors’ discretion, students who participated in the study received extra credit, or if choosing not to participate in the study, students were provided with an opportunity to complete a separate assignment for the same credit. Of the 52 students surveyed, 41, aged 19–25, completed the survey. Twenty-four participants were female (58.6%) and seventeen were male (41.4%).

Material
Twenty-four news images across six news topics were selected for this study. The six news topics were determined by surveying 25 university students in a pretest where they discussed perceived controversy levels of 20 news topics. The perceived controversial nature of the images was an important element for this study because we sought to understand how the respondents would perceive the valence (positive or negative) of the image differently based on various RoT conditions. In other words, we postulated that depicting controversial topics (pro vs con perspectives) would result in a distinct valence structure (positive or negative emotions). The following six topics received the most responses in the pretest, which we then selected for this study: drinking (healthy lifestyle vs binge drinking), gay marriage (pro vs con), Greek life (brother/sisterhood vs hazing), football (glory of sport vs injuries), U.S. troops abroad (fighting for our country vs mistreating prisoners), and President (pro vs con).

Four news images for each news topic were selected using a Google image search of each topic followed by each word in parentheses above (e.g., “Greek life brotherhood/sisterhood” and “Greek life hazing”). Two images per story and per aspect (i.e., two positive/two negative) were selected randomly from the search results. The image orientation was not a factor in selection of photos for this study but the majority of images were horizontal while only two were vertical. The general Google image search was used deliberately to reflect the generic exposure to news images online. For the purpose of this experiment, we aimed to control perceived valence type by selecting images for all topics that tended in one valence direction (either positive or negative). For instance, negative images about gay marriage depicted only anti-gay marriage protesters holding disparaging signs and positive images depicted only happy (smiling) just-married gay couples. By the same token positive military images only showed smiling soldiers and negative images depicted scenes of a wounded soldier or abuse of a prisoner by a soldier. Using a wide range of topics allowed us to control for possible individual biases regarding a specific topic.

In order to further ensure that our selection of images portray a valence direction (positive or negative) we conducted a manipulation check of the stimuli material. Ten photojournalism experts with expertise in both still photography and videography (professional photographers—including photojournalists at CNN, the White House Press Corps and the Baltimore Sun,—university educators or both) examined the selected images for compliance with the RoT. The experts also rated and determined the valence (as either positive or negative) of each image. Their comments about each image determined the main subject of each image, and the levels for each independent variable (“rule of thirds composition,” “rule of thirds main subject”), which was essential for coding the experiment survey data. In sum, we operationalized the experts’ opinion as the accurate understanding of the main subject, composition and the intended valence of each image (positive/negative).

</p> <p> Respondents’ answers were then coded as either “congruent with experts” opinion or “not congruent with experts” opinion. As a result, 15 out of the 24 images were identified as complying with the RoT in terms of composition, and 14 images as having main subjects complying with the RoT. In summary, out of 984 total cases, there were 492 per valence type (positive, negative); 615 following the RoT in terms of image composition; and 574 with the main subject following the RoT.

Procedure
Participants received a link to an online survey hosted by Qualtrics software. Upon activating the link, participants received brief instructions concerning the procedures and the option to withdraw at any time from the experiment. Then each of the 41 participants was shown the stimulus material (24 images) one image at a time, equaling 984 image views in total. In order to avoid potential carry over effects arising from the order of images shown, we randomized the image sequence for each participant. 

After exposure to each image, participants had to fill out a three-question survey. The first question asked about the perceived valence of the image or how it made participants feel, using a 1–9 Likert scale (1 being “extremely negative” and 9 being “extremely positive”). The second and third questions asked participants to write down what they perceived as the main subject of the image and what they thought the story was, as could be told from the image. In the online survey, participants were not able to navigate back and forth from image to image. Participants took, on average, 42 minutes to complete the experiment. The completion time ranged from 23 to 57 minutes.

Results
Rule of Thirds and Perceived Valence
In order to address the first research question—Does the rule of thirds have a significant effect on the perceived valence of images?—we tested whether participants perceived the direction of valence for an image 

o each image’s predetermined valence (positive or negative). A one way ANOVA with mean values for perceived valence ratings for each image valence type (positive n1= 492; negative n2= 492) found that valence type of the image was a significant factor for the respondents’ perceived valence and its direction. Participants’ responses were highly skewed toward each end of the scale (1 and 9) in the direction of the predetermined (positive and negative) valence (M1= 6.82, SD= 1.38, M2= 3.09, SD= 1.66, F(1, 982) = 1473.80, p < .001).

The distribution of images with a positive and negative valence in respect to RoT composition and main subject is not fully balanced. This imbalance is due to the Google search that we conducted, which aimed to reflect a wide variety of images, as they are found online. We took the conservative approach and tested if the unequal distribution may skew the valence perception. We ran several independent sample t-tests to examine if equality of variances is met. The Levene’s tests for equality of variances were not statistically significant indicating that the different groups’ variances are similar. Thus, the group size differences did not impact the analysis. Perceived valence scores were more negative when a negative valence image complied with the “rule of thirds composition” (M= 2.69, SD= 1.54) then if it did not (M= 4.27. SD= 1.45), t(490) = 9.98, p < .001, d = 1.05. A t-test between the positive valence groups also showed that participants perceived valence stronger when images complied with the rule n = 246 (M= 7.32, SD= 1.26) than if they did not n = 246 (M= 6.33, SD= 1.31), t(490) = 8.59, p < .001, d = .75.

A t-test was also conducted to test the unequal group sizes for main subject RoT compliance and valence. Participants perceived higher positive valence when images complied with the RoT in respect to the main subject position n= 287 (M= 7.13, SD= 1.36) than when images did not have a main subject placed in the RoT grid n= 205 (M= 6.39, SD= 1.29), t(490) = 6.1, p < .001, d= .56. Another t-test confirmed the overall tendency that compliance with the RoT evokes stronger directional valence perceptions. Participants perceived images more negatively when the main subject was positioned in the RoT grid (M = 2.61, SD = 1.44) than if it wasn’t (M = 3.75, SD = 1.73), t(389) = 7.67, p < .001, 
d = .71.

</p> <p> We also ran a number of ANOVAs to compare valence perceptions (positive and negative) in respect to the presence of the rules of thirds (i.e., RoT compliance/non-compliance) and whether the main subject was positioned in the RoT grid or not. All of the ANOVAs supported the t-test results. First, we compared positive valence perceptions of images compliant with the RoT with images that were non-compliant. Again, the presence of RoT composition showed that participants perceived an image as more positive (M1) than without RoT (M2) composition (M1= 7.32, SD= 1.26, M2= 6.33, SD= 1.31, F(1, 491) = 73.84, p < .001). We then repeated this step by comparing whether negative valence perceptions followed a similar pattern. Again, when images were compliant with the RoT, negative valence perception was more pronounced (M1) than without RoT (M2) compliance (M1= 2.69, SD= 1.54, M2= 4.27, SD= 1.45, F(1, 491) = 99.61, p < .001).

Next, we examined if the valence perceptions were affected by the presence of the main subject (MS) in the RoT grid. Both the positive valence (M1= 7.13, SD= 1.36, M2= 6.39, SD= 1.29, F(1, 491) = 37.28, p < .001) and the negative valence (MS on RoT grid M1= 2.61, SD= 1.44, MS not on RoT grid M2= 3.75, SD= 1.73, F(1, 491) = 62.44, p < .001) were significantly more pronounced when the main subject was positioned on RoT grid than not.

In order to see if the previous tendencies are robust, we further examined whether there were significant differences in the overall perceived valence ratings of the images (positive and negative combined) across the two RoT characteristics (composition, main subject). A two-way ANOVA was conducted to compare means of perceived valence for the two types of RoT characteristics. When RoT was followed for composition (n = 615), the average perceived valence rating was 4.59 (SD= 2.71), and 4.34 (SD= 2.57) when it was not (n= 369), showing a significantly different rating when the RoT for composition was followed, F(1, 983) = 64.87, p < .001. Similarly, RoT for the main subject was also a significant factor for differences in the overall perceived valence ratings. Compliance to RoT for main subject (n = 574) showed a mean of 6.59 (SD= 1.36) and non-compliance a mean of 5.37 (SD= 1.65). Differences were significant, F(1, 983) = 15.39, p < .001. We further examined the valence and RoT compliance by analyzing each type of RoT compliance. Differences in mean perceived valence were significantly higher when the RoT was not followed in terms of composition, but followed in terms of main subject (F(1, 983) = 6.55, p < .05). In other words, placing the main subject on the RoT grid proved to be
a more significant indicator for differences in valence perception.

Rule of Thirds and Identification 
of Main Subject
ANCOVA showed that only the RoT in terms of main subject was a significant factor for congruency of main subject identification. When the RoT was present for main subject (n= 573), the mean score for congruency was .59 (SD= .49) and when it was not present (n= 411), the mean score was significantly lower at .50 (SD= .50), F(1,
983) = 11.43, p < .01. 

Also, significant interactions were found for each type of RoT compliance. Differences of congruency between predetemined (expert based) main subject identification and respondents were significantly higher when the RoT was not followed in terms of composition, but followed in terms of main subject (F(1, 983) = 54.70, p < .001). Thus, the RoT
compliance with regard to main subject yielded higher scores, making it easier for participants to identify the main subject . 

Conclusion and Discussion
This exploratory study took a first step to test possible effects of the RoT on participants’ perceptions of news images. We tested whether the RoT would make the main subject and the valence of a news photograph more salient. Our data analysis provides a tentative but promising indication that the RoT may be more than simply an aesthetical compositional tool; it appears to also assist in the information processing of visual stimuli. The results for both of our research questions—that explored whether the RoT has a significant effect on valence and main subject perception—suggest that participants’ perceptions were indeed guided by the RoT grid as they processed the visual information more accurately. The perceived valence of images was significantly higher when those images followed the RoT in their composition than when they didn’t. The differences for perceived valence were also higher when the main subject was positioned in the intersections of the RoT grid, than if it was not. This means that valence perception was stronger (more vivid) for images with the main subject complying with the RoT. In other words, participants were better able to correctly recognize the most important part of an image and as such an integral part of the narrative of the image.

The RoT also aided the identification of the main subject. Our analysis of covariance showed that participants were more likely than not to identify the main subject when it was located in the RoT grid. The interaction effects that we found also pointed towards the importance of placing the main subject on the RoT grid. Valence was higher when the main subject was located on the RoT grid than when an image merely followed a “rule of thirds composition.” This indicates that the RoT could have significant effects in conveying the story of a picture more forcefully, making it more salient and easier to process.

These findings are promising indicators that the RoT may ease information processing and as such has the potential to minimize possible errors in visual communication. Specifically, our findings suggest that the RoT could help avoid misidentifications of the main subject. The geometrical structures guide the process of vision by raising attention toward the focus of interest of an image, thereby filtering out irrelevant information. The process of visual cognition is guided by attention, which in turn is primarily triggered by the recognition of geometrical shapes and surfaces, symmetry, and spatial relationships. We argue that a similar process appears to facilitate the effectiveness of the RoT in establishing “visual priorities.”

The significance of our results emphasizes the importance of the RoT for journalistic storytelling—not merely to raise attention, but also to effectively convey the focus point of an image. Images complying with the RoT can be considered more efficient in pointing toward relevant news content. But more specifically, when photojournalists have to choose between overall image composition or placing the main subject on to the RoT grid, they should favor the latter over the former to most effectively communicate visual content. The need to clearly communicate visual content is getting increasingly important as the consumption of visual news content continues to grow. Findings also indicate that in particular controversial news concerning social, political, or environmental issues would benefit from employing the RoT to emphasize the valence of an image, as increasing the emotional and/or affective salience of an image can facilitate greater engagement with the visual content.

</p> <p> Limitations and Prospects for Future Research
Even though our study shows significant effects, there are a number of limitations that need to be addressed to move research on the RoT forward. First of all, there are no clear guidelines about the use and implementation of the RoT. This makes it very challenging to assess images, and even experienced 
photojournalists and experts often disagree on whether a particular photo follows the rule or not. This also created some problems in our study since we designed our project to reflect the everyday news photo consumption experience online. The Google Image search did not provide us with an equal number of images that followed the RoT and those that did not comply with the compositional guideline. In a follow-up study, it would seem prudent to implement a series of tests 
by using images that unmistakably abide by the RoT or to possibly use a machine vision analysis to help detect the presence of the RoT. At the same time, it would be greatly beneficial to control for other aspects of an image such as color, contrast, brightness, depth of field, object size, image orientation (vertical vs horizontal), and so on to clearly parse out the impact of the RoT on information processing and main information detection of an image. Such examinations would also allow us to investigate the perception of overall news photography quality in relation to the presence and absence of the RoT in order to tease out possible aesthetical effects.

Moreover, our conceptualization of valence has some limitations because not all individuals may follow normative valence perceptions. In other words, some may evaluate distraught faces, abuse, or anger as positive rather than negative. Thus, our study cannot claim to universally describe, measure, or predict valence. In future studies, it would also be worthwhile to expand the research, using a larger population sample, and to test and control for political partisanship, attitudes, or other biases that may be influencing participants’ perceptions of controversial topics. The fact that we used an online experimental setting may also have influenced our findings, and it may be worthwhile to conduct a similar study in a more controlled environment. This study is just a first step in looking more closely at the significance of the RoT in conveying relevant information within journalistic storytelling. Much more needs to be done to understand this compositional rule and its effects on visual cognition, especially as images are becoming increasingly pivotal in the selection of news content and influential in the understanding of news.

Evaluating the Rule of Thirds in Photographs 
and Paintings <br><br>
Seyed Ali Amirshahi , Gregor Uwe Hayn-Leichsenring, Joachim Denzler, and Christoph Redies<br><br>

In 1797, John Thomas Smith proclaimed that the rule of thirds represents a more harmonizing proportion to follow in paintings of rural scenery than any other proportion. Ever since, the rule of thirds has been referred to as an important principle governing the spatial composition of aesthetic images. Although different descriptions have been given for the rule of thirds, most if not all of them suggest that, in order to create a photograph or painting of high aesthetic quality, the main object or focus point should be placed along one of the two imaginary horizontal or the two imaginary vertical lines that divide the image into nine equal parts (the third lines). For example, in his treatise, Smith advocated to fill the painting area by “two thirds of one element (as of water) to one third of another element (as of land),” rather than placing their border in the center of the painting.

According to art critics and experts in photography, the rule of thirds is one of the most important composition rules used in painting and photography. In one version of the rule of thirds, the focus point in an image is placed along one of the third lines. In another version, the focus point is placed on one of the four intersections of the third lines. Photographs that follow the rule of thirds show the main focus point or object on or near the third lines or on their intersections. Photographs that do not follow the rule of thirds are also evident in contrast.

</p> <p> Others, for example, Arnheim in his study of compositional balance in images 
of simple geometric forms, stressed the perceptual importance of the center of the image and the objects that it contains. Tyler reported a general tendency in art portraits that one of the eyes of the person depicted is centered along the midline in rectangular paintings. However, other researchers have found no evidence for such a bias. Palmer et al. reviewed some of the discrepancies between the on-center and off-center theories. They conducted a series of psychological experiments that confirmed the on-center bias, but only for forward-facing symmetrical objects; left-facing and right-facing objects tended to be located off-center. For vertically positioned objects, people preferred positions in the image that reflected spatial asymmetries in their functional properties and the typical position of the object relative to the observer. Moreover, Leyssen demonstrated that semantics plays a role in images containing two meaningful objects. Observers preferred images in which semantically related objects were close together and unrelated objects were far apart. McManus extended this type of investigation to other major axes in the rectangular frame of photographs. They critically evaluated Arnheim’s theory of visual balance and found no evidence to support it. Nevertheless, this and a previous study by the authors demonstrated that there are reproducible rules, according to which naive participants and experts reach aesthetic judgments on photographs.

Some recent psychological studies provided precise physical definitions for concepts such as balance in images and investigated large numbers of images, but some of the earlier studies were less clear on how they measure image properties, or they based their results on a rather limited number of images. In the field of computational aesthetics, well-defined local and global physical properties were measured in large sets of images by modern digital image processing tools. However, the computational studies focused largely on simple, low-level features that can hardly explain the variability of aesthetic responses amongst humans or top-down cognitive processes involved in aesthetic judgments. Also, claims in computational aesthetics that the statistical properties relate to perceptual phenomena were sometimes not supported by data from rigorous psychological experiments. Therefore, a combination of both approaches is warranted to study the 

determinants of individual preference.
In computational aesthetics, an increasing amount of studies on the quality assessment of images and videos was published in the last few years. Recently, there has been a shift of interest towards the aesthetic quality assessment of paintings and photographs. Extracting multiple features from paintings and
photographs is one of the common approaches taken in computational aesthetics. Most metrics share common features, for example, exposure of light, colorfulness, saturation, hue, aspect ratio, shape convexity, etc. Interestingly, the rule-of-thirds feature is amongst the features commonly used to assess the composition in paintings and photographs. For example, Datta et al. (2006) extracted 56 features and Li and Chen (2009)
extracted 40 features from the image and used these features in their pooling  system system to come up with a score to assess the aesthetic quality of photographs and paintings based on subjective high-quality or low-quality ratings. In both metrics, the rule of thirds is used as a feature. An aspect common to both metrics is that the computations are restricted to the central window outlined by the third lines. The reasoning behind this selection was that objects positioned on one of the third lines tend to stretch toward the central point, and observers tend to focus on the center part of the painting.

Mai and collaborators developed a computer-assisted method to predict whether a photograph respects the rule of thirds or not. They based their method on maps of saliency for each image. Saliency maps highlight image regions that are different from their surroundings and are calculated with the aim of predicting average looking behavior. Mai built a classifier that achieved around 80% accuracy in automatically detecting the rule of thirds in a photograph. Similar or related methods have been used in unsupervised cropping methods for digital photography. However, at present, the computer-based approaches cannot take into account semantic meaning, which also contributes to the appearance of image content as salient for human observers. Such top-down processing has an effect on looking behavior and, consequently, on the subjective assessment of whether an image obeys the rule of thirds.

</p> <p> There are many different ways of defining what may stick out in an image, and, consequently, there are many metrics to calculate saliency maps. In a recent survey of 35 such methods, researchers systematically studied their accuracy in predicting eye movements. Accuracy varied greatly between the different methods, depending on how accuracy was defined and the perceptual task involved (e.g., looking at synthetic versus natural images), but some methods consistently performed better than others. In the realm of art, eye movements were recorded in participants who viewed paintings from different Western art periods and compared the fixation maps with two different types of saliency maps. They found a high, but not perfect correlation between the saliency maps and the behavioral data. Similar results were obtained with a dataset of abstract and figurative paintings, and it was observed that the effect of saliency on eye fixations is short-lived.

In the study by Mai, the authors did not correlate the performance of their automatic rule-of-thirds (ROT) classifier with subjective ROT ratings. It also remained unclear whether the photographs that followed the rule of thirds were perceived as more aesthetic. These issues will be addressed in the present study by comparing computed ROT values and subjective ROT rating scores. We also propose an algorithm that calculates ROT values in real-time without the need of training a classifier. 
Three different methods for computing saliency were compared. As controls, we studied two additional datasets that do not follow the rule of thirds. Finally, we studied photographs that were rated as highly aesthetic by the users of a web-based photography forum, and artworks of Western provenance. We asked the following questions:

(1) How well do the calculated ROT values correlate with subjective ROT scores?

(2) How high are calculated ROT values for high-quality photographs and artists’ paintings of Western provenance? Do paintings differ in their values, depending on the content that is depicted in the paintings (abstract art, portraits, natural scenes or complex scenes with persons)?

(3) Are photographs that follow the rule of thirds perceived as more aesthetic than those that do not?

Material and Methods
Image Datasets Used
We used five different image datasets in our experiments to assess the performance of the proposed metrics and for evaluating the rule of thirds in paintings and photographs. Sample images from each image category are shown in Fig. 2.

Rule-of-Thirds Photographs
</p> <p> This dataset consists of 679 photographs, which were randomly selected from a dataset of 2089 photographs that follow the rule of thirds and were collected by Mai. As a control, we randomly selected 403 photographs from a dataset of images by the same 
authors that do not follow the rule of thirds. However, images were selected so that the mean values for the two groups matched approximately in terms of self-similarity, complexity, and anisotropy. Both types of images were gathered from the photo-sharing websites Flickr and Photo.net. Selection was based on the question of whether they did or did not follow the rule of thirds; whether the images were aesthetic or not, did not play a role in their selection, especially in the case of the photographs downloaded from the Flickr website. The two datasets do not share any images with the dataset.

Photographs Taken Almost Randomly
As another control, we analyzed a dataset of 606 photographs kindly provided by Prof. Chris McManus, University College, London. Image size was 2048 × 1536 pixels. The photographs were taken with a Canon Ixus 82 IS digital camera while the photographer was walking down streets or parks, sitting on buses or trains, in buildings, or other locations. The photographer made an explicit attempt to avoid pointing the camera at objects. Moreover, where possible, photographs were sampled at a regular interval to avoid a selection bias for particular objects or scenes. As a result, the photographs are examples of images that do not follow the rule of thirds. Sample photographs from the dataset are shown in Fig. 2k–o.

Photographs of Simple Scenes of Objects
This dataset consists of 200 photographs of simple (non-complex) scenes with one or only a few household and laboratory objects. The images were taken using a 15.1-megapixel digital camera (EOS 500D with EF-85 mm f/3.5–5.6 IS USM lens; Canon, Tokyo, Japan), as described previously. The main focus points of the images were the objects shown; the rule of thirds or other aesthetic criteria were not intentionally followed. Figure 2p–t represents sample images from this dataset. This database is available for public use through the website of our research group.

High-Quality Photographs (Photo.net)
This dataset consists of 200 photographs downloaded from the photo-sharing website Photo.net. The images were randomly selected from photographs that have an aesthetic rating of more than 5.5 out of a scale of 1 to 7. The ratings were given by the members of the website, that is, they were peer-reviewed by professional and amateur photographers. 

Paintings
This dataset consists of 727 paintings and comprises artworks of around 200 Western painters from a wide range of different centuries and a large variety of diverse art styles. The paintings were produced by well-known artists and collected by prestigious museums. The paintings were scanned from high-quality art books by our group using a calibrated digital scanner (Perfection 3200 Photo, Epson). To test whether the subject matter depicted in the paintings had an effect on the calculated ROT values, we classified the majority of the paintings based on their content. To reach reliable results, four categories of subject matter that contained large numbers of paintings were selected from the dataset. The categories were: abstract artworks (188 paintings), natural scenes (54 paintings), complex scenes with persons (151 paintings), and portraits (191 paintings).

</p> <p> Image Calculations
Computational methods to study whether image composition complies with the rule of thirds have been proposed previously. As examples, we mentioned the studies by Datta and Li and Chen in the Introduction section. In the two studies, rule-of-thirds-related features are used as an input value in a pooling system that is designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of a painting or photograph. By themselves, these features cannot predict the overall aesthetic quality of an artwork.

Mai calculated different features based on saliency maps and used them in a classifier to determine whether an image followed the rule of thirds or not. Saliency maps have been used in different image and video quality metrics as well as in the field of computational aesthetics. Extending the work by Mai and colleagues, we propose a simple, robust, and fast method to assess the rule of thirds. Unlike the previous approach, which is a supervised method, our method is unsupervised and does not require prior training of a classifier.

Over the last few years, a number of different ways to calculate visual saliency maps have been proposed. In the present work, we employ three well-established metrics, which we refer to as the frequency-tuned (FT) method, the ITTI method, and the graph-based visual saliency (GBVS) method. In the FT method, the distance between the Lab pixel vector in a Gaussian-filtered image and the mean Lab vector for the image is calculated. The ITTI method is based on the use of the Gaussian blur filter. This filter is applied to the image in a pyramid manner and the difference between the original image and level 4 of the pyramid is calculated. The GBVS method takes the same approach as the ITTI method, but the calculations are done at higher levels.

In the proposed approach, we first calculated the saliency map for each image. The previous methods by Datta and Li and Chen were based on calculating mean values over a central region in the original image in separate color channels in the HSV and HSL color space. In the present study, we determined the maximum sum of saliency over four different regions that were related to the rule of thirds. Two approaches for selecting the regions of interest were followed. In the first approach, we used four boxes that were each centered on one of the intersections of the third lines  as the regions of interest. In the second approach, we introduced four stripes that were each centered on one of the third lines. The stripes and the boxes had a width and height that corresponded to 10%, 16% or 20% of the width and height of the image, respectively. Next, we calculated the mean saliency value for each of the four regions and then took the maximum value as a measure for the saliency placed on the third lines. For details of the calculations, see the Supplementary Appendix.

Initially, we calculated stripes and boxes with different widths for all three saliency methods (FT, ITTI and GBVS). Because the GBVS method with boxes of a 16% width gave the best correlations with subjective ratings of the degree to which an image followed the rule of thirds, this combination of parameters was used for the rest of the study.

To investigate whether saliency maps can be used to evaluate the existence of the rule of thirds, we measured the mean saliency over all images in each dataset introduced above. For each image, saliency maps were normalized to sum up to 1. To calculate the mean saliency map for each image category, we first resized each image in the category to 1024 × 1024 pixels so that the saliency maps of all images could be added to one another on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The result was then divided by the number of images in each category.

</p> <p> Rating Experiments
Participants
Twenty participants between 19 and 41 years (mean age: 26.8 ± 5.9 SD, nine males) rated the aesthetics of presented images (Experiment 1). 
Ten other participants between 22 and 33 years (mean age: 26.1 ± 3.4 SD, four males) estimated the degree to which the images followed the rule of thirds.

Stimuli
We used the dataset described in who separated the dataset into a subset of photographs that follow the rule of thirds, and a subset that does not obey the rule of thirds. From each subset, we randomly selected 100 images (200 images in total). The majority of photographs were color images, but grayscale images were also used. To achieve a consistent display on the screen, we reduced the size of all images to 800 pixels on the longer side. Smaller images were shown at their original size. In Experiment 2, we drew thin white lines on the images to indicate the third lines. All images were presented with a maximum size of 20.5 cm (longest side) on a computer 

screen. Participants viewed stimuli from a distance of 90 cm (assured by a chin rest). Hence, images covered a maximum of 13° of the visual angle.

Experiment 1: Rating of Aesthetic Appearance
First, we showed ten example images for 2 s each to get the participants acquainted with the database. Then, participants were asked to rate the images according to their aesthetics on a mouse-based scale. The scale for the aesthetics rating was from 0 to 1 and continuous (100 steps, not visible to the participants) and endpoints were labeled with ‘not aesthetic’ and ‘aesthetic’, respectively (or the German equivalent to those terms). There was no time restriction. After response by clicking on the scale, the next image appeared. The 200 stimuli were presented separately and in random order on a black screen. Before each image appeared on the screen, the cursor of the mouse was 
set to the midpoint of the scale.

Experiment 2: Rating of the Presence of the Rule of Thirds
First, we showed the participants three sample images. One of the images followed the rule of thirds based on the fact that the focus of interest was placed along one of the third lines. Another image followed the rule of thirds based on the fact that the focus of interest was on one of the intersections of the third lines. The third image did not follow the rule of thirds. In the experiment, ten example images were shown for 2 s to introduce the database. Then, participants were asked to evaluate by mouse click whether or not the focus point of the images was on one of the third lines or, in another round, on one of the four intersections of the third lines. The participants were asked to choose between the left (‘no’) and the right side (‘yes’) of a scale. They also had the option of selecting intermediate positions on the scale so that they could indicate the degree to which an image followed the rule of thirds. There was no time restriction. After the response, the next image appeared. The 200 stimuli were presented separately and in random order on the black screen. Five participants evaluated the third lines first and the other five participants evaluated the intersection points first.

</p> <p> Subjective Rule-of-Thirds (ROT) Rating
As a baseline for this study, we first asked ten participants to rate the degree to which 200 photographs followed the ROT. In separate sessions, participants evaluated two different ROT criteria that are commonly used. In one session, they assessed whether the focus of interest was on one of the third lines. In another session, they assessed whether the focus of interest was on one of the intersections of the third lines. For the rating, we selected 100 images that followed the ROT (here called ROT+ images) and 100 images that did not follow it (ROT− images) from the dataset.

For the rating based on the intersections, the ROT+ photographs received an average score of 0.76 ± 0.17 SD on a continuous scale from 0 to 1. As expected, the average score of ROT− photographs was much lower (0.23 ± 0.22 SD; p < 0.0001, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test; Cohen’s d = 2.71). The corresponding scores for the rating based on the third lines were 0.62 ± 0.22 SD and 0.35 ± 0.23 SD, respectively (p < 0.0001; d = 1.21).

Calculation of Saliency-Based ROT Measure
Next, we calculated saliency-based ROT values for the three methods (GBVS, ITTI and FS) with different parameters and asked which paradigm yielded the highest correlations with the subjective ROT ratings. The same 200 photographs were used as described in Section 3.1. Results indicate that the highest correlations were obtained for the GBVS method with boxes of 16% width placed on the intersections of the third lines. For this metric, Fig. 3 shows a dot plot of the subjective ROT rating versus the calculated ROT measure. Largely confirming the initial classification, the majority of ROT− images (blue dots in Fig. 3) received not only low scores for subjective ROT ratings (see above) but also low values calculated for ROT (mean 0.069 ± 0.016 SD). 
In contrast, the ROT values calculated for the ROT+ images (red squares in Fig. 3), which received high subjective ROT scores, scattered more widely at a much higher level (mean 0.109 ± 0.058 SD; p < 0.0001, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test; d = 0.94). While the subjective ROT scores did not correlate with the calculated ROT values for the ROT− images, we found a moderate correlation between the two measures for the ROT+ images (red regression line in Fig. 3).

Because the GBVS metric resulted in the highest overall correlation between calculated ROT values and subjective ROT scores, we used this metric in the rest of the study. This choice was in agreement with a recent survey of 35 saliency metrics, in which the GBVS method outperformed most of the other methods in eye movement prediction accuracy.

We also compared the subjective ROT scores with the ROT values that were calculated with the methods introduced by Datta and Li and Chen. However, no correlation was found. We conclude that the two metrics do not help us in distinguishing between images that follow or do not follow the rule of thirds in our dataset of images.
In the majority of images, the 

positions of high saliency values (yellow to red color) correspond to subjective focus points of interest.
</p> <p> Confirming similar results, the average saliency map for the ROT+ images shows highest saliency values in the box that is centered on the lower right intersection of the third lines, but also relatively high values at the other intersections. By contrast, saliency is highest in the center of the ROT− photographs. A similar central peak of saliency is observed for the photographs of scenes taken almost randomly, the simple scenes of objects, and the high-quality photographs. For the entire painting dataset, there is a central tendency for high saliency values, but peak saliency is shifted slightly towards the upper left corner. A separate analysis for the different categories of paintings reveals that this shift is especially prominent in portraits. The position of this peak may relate to the tendency of artists to place the faces, which are highly salient, into the upper regions of the paintings where they are close to or covered by the third lines. Average saliency in the other categories of painting categories is more evenly distributed across the images.

The above results were quantified by calculating the saliency values with the GBVS method (boxes overlying intersections, 16% width) for each image separately. The results confirm that the ROT+ images have higher mean saliency values (0.102 ± 0.053 SD) than the ROT− photographs (0.067 ± 0.016 SD); p < 0.001; d = 0.90) as well as all the other image categories (for all other comparisons, p < 0.001, Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison test; d = 0.73 to 1.73). Among the paintings, portraits have higher values (0.068 ± 0.016 SD) than abstract images (0.059 ± 0.018 SD; p < 0.001, d = 0.46) and complex scenes with persons (0.061 ± 0.013 SD; p < 0.001, d = 0.55).
Subjective Rating of Beauty
In the last part of this study, participants rated the aesthetics of the 100 ROT+ photographs and 100 ROT− photographs that had been previously assessed for the degree to which they complied with the rule of thirds. The mean aesthetic rating score for the ROT+ images (0.59 ± 0.14 SD) was slightly higher than that of the ROT− images (0.54 ± 0.14 SD; p < 0.01, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test, d = 0.36). Aesthetic rating scores were plotted as a function of the subjective ROT scores and the calculated ROT values. There was a weak overall correlation between the aesthetic rating score and the subjective ROT rating score (Spearman ρ = 0.17, p < 0.05). However, the aesthetic rating score did not correlate significantly with the calculated ROT measure.

Discussion
Computational versus Behavioral Measures for the Rule of Thirds
We used three different saliency metrics to calculate two rule-of-third (ROT) measures and validated the results in comparison with subjective data from participants who rated the degree to which photographs followed the rule of thirds in a psychological experiment. Compared to the other methods, the GBVS metrics with boxes centered on the intersections of the third lines yielded the strongest correlations between the computed data and the subjective scores. The GBVS method was shown previously to be an outstanding metric to predict looking behavior in a comparative study of saliency methods.

Overall, the correlation between computed ROT values and behavioral scores was of intermediate strength (Spearman ρ = 0.47). For photographs that did not follow the rule of thirds on subjective grounds (ROT− images), low calculated ROT values were obtained on average. The two control databases, which had not been generated to comply with the rule of thirds (almost random photographs and simple scenes of objects) also yielded low calculated ROT values. 
By contrast, average calculated ROT values were much higher for photographs that were rated as concordant with the rule of thirds in the present study (ROT+ images). However, computed values scattered widely and the correlation with the subjective ROT scores was relatively weak (Spearman ρ = 0.31). Therefore, we conclude that factors other than saliency are likely to contribute to subjective ROT ratings. Presumably, top-down mechanisms that take the semantics of a photograph into account are amongst the most relevant factors. A similar combination of bottom-up (saliency-based) and top-down (cognitive) mechanisms has been invoked in the prediction of eye movements. In conclusion, we demonstrate that low-level visual saliency contributes to the perception of the rule of thirds in photographs in a bottom-up fashion.

Strikingly, the mean saliency maps demonstrate that peak saliency in the rule-of-thirds (ROT+) photographs is not evenly distributed across the boxes overlying the four intersections of the third lines. Instead, they are concentrated in the lower left box. It remains to be investigated whether this observation is unique to the dataset analyzed in the present study, corresponds to a more general tendency by photographers, or reflects other compositional rules.

The present results corroborate the study by Mai et al., which achieved 
a 72–80% classification rate of photographs that followed the rule of thirds versus photographs that did not. However, unlike the study by Mai et al., the method proposed by us does not require any prior training of a classifier. It represents an automated tool that instantly delivers a single measure, which can contribute to the question of whether a photograph complies with the rule of thirds. As such, practicing artists or photographers may use this method in isolation during their work. A robust, fast and reliable method for measuring the ROT feature might be valuable also for research in the field of experimental aesthetics. 

Correlation of Aesthetic Ratings with Rule-of-Thirds Judgments and Measures
The rule of thirds is a feature that is widely used to assess the aesthetic quality of paintings and photographs. In the present study, we challenged the validity of this approach by relating aesthetic rating scores to ROT rating scores for a dataset of 200 photographs. The two scores correlated only weakly (Spearman ρ = 0.17). Moreover, there was no correlation between the aesthetic rating score and the calculated ROT measure. The mean calculated ROT values for aesthetic photographs were only slightly higher than those of control photographs that do not follow the rule of thirds. These results suggest that the rule of thirds plays only a minor, if any, role in the aesthetic evaluation of photographs.

</p> <p> ROT Values Computed for Paintings
Low calculated ROT values were also observed for the dataset of paintings. However, we did not obtain subjective rating scores for the aesthetic value of the paintings. Nevertheless, curators of prestigious art museums considered their acquisition worthwhile, probably because of the superior artistic quality of the paintings. Also, we did not rate the degree to which the paintings followed the rule of thirds. Nevertheless, the low calculated ROT values for paintings suggest that the rule of thirds, at least as far as it is based on saliency-based mechanisms, is not a decisive factor for determining the visual quality of the paintings.

Mean saliency maps for portrait paintings showed a prominent peak close to the upper left box. This peak likely corresponds to the average position of the faces in portrait paintings. It results in relatively high saliency values close to the upper left ROT box and, consequently, leads to slightly higher calculated ROT values. Average saliency in the other categories of paintings is more evenly distributed and mean saliency values are about as low as in photographs that do not follow the rule of thirds.

Conclusions
In summary, our findings suggest that the rule of thirds might not be as important for the evaluation of the visual quality in photographs and artworks as previously assumed. Evidently, not following this rule does not necessarily result in images of low visual quality. We can only speculate why the rule of thirds plays such an important role in textbooks on photography and art. Perhaps, like the golden section, the rule of thirds mirrors the desire of artists and photographers to comprehend rules of artistic composition. Therefore, it might have become a normative aspect of creating artworks rather than a qualitative one. The rule of thirds may also help beginners to endow the products of their creativity with a particular visual structure under conscious control. Eventually, as artists gain intuitive expertise in artistic composition, they may drop the rule, which might be the reason why we did not find it in high-quality photographs and artworks.

                    Guided by the Grid: Raising Attention with the Rule of Thirds <br><br>

                    Introduction
              The rule of thirds (RoT), in art and photography, refers to making use of the intersections of four imaginary lines that divide an image into thirds, horizontally and vertically, to alter the composition of an image. Although many people may not be aware of the term “rule of thirds,” they may very well apply it on a daily basis when taking pictures with their mobile devices. Digital cameras and camera apps normally have a RoT grid option to assist the user in taking a photograph. Most photo editing software also provide a RoT layer to guide the cropping process of a picture. Virtually any book on learning photography will discuss the RoT. One of the goals of employing the RoT is to compose an aesthetically pleasing and balanced image composition but also to position the most important information within the image in such a way as to communicate it saliently, thereby increasing the probability of a more accurate identification
    of the most important information of an image. 
    
    The RoT as a guiding principle of image composition and image perception
    is especially relevant in the digital news media environment, with its increasing emphasis on visual culture. Visual news has been predicted to be replacing text-based news as the main source of information. Photos and videos are and continue to be important in the online communication economy on social media as well as in political communication and participation. In fact, news consumers increasingly share and consume visual information. For instance, over the past few years, the consumption of online news videos alone doubled across several countries in the Americas and Europe.
    
    The proliferation of visual information has a number of implications for the production and perception of visual news content. On the one hand, the demand for images as an essential tool for journalistic storytelling created a demand for multimedia skills to produce professional high-quality visual content. Students in video and photography classes, including in the U.S., 
    where this study was conducted, learn using RoT in order to improve the composition of an image (while abiding by journalistic principles and ethics). Possessing such a skill has been deemed to be one of the differences between visual content produced by professional journalists and amateurs.
    
On the other hand, a shift toward more visual content may impact the way users, readers, and audiences perceive information and news. Scholars speak of a visual primacy effect that highlights the salience of visual cues over verbal ones. Empirical research shows that visual cues can overshadow textual information or carry biases such as in political news coverage, environmental news, conflict coverage, but also on social media. People have the tendency—at least on Facebook—to form impressions about others primarily based on their profile photos, rather than on the verbal self-disclosures that accompany these images.
    
    The proliferation of visual information and the dominance of visual over textual information, as described by the visual primacy effect, indicate the need to improve the creation of visual information such as photographs. The RoT may be able to assist in this process by making the focus point of an image more salient and thus reducing the probability of information processing errors. Yet, despite the ubiquity of visual content and wide use of the RoT as a decision-making tool for composition, research has not expansively explored the effectiveness of the RoT as a way to guide attention within visual communication. This exploratory study attempts to fill this gap in research by theorizing and testing the RoT as a geometrical structure that assists the processing of visual information.
    
    Literature Review
    The Rule of Thirds: Practice and Theory
    Since the fifteenth century, artists have been using the Rule of Thirds (RoT) to make certain crucial parts of an image more salient. Specifically, the RoT is used to determine areas of interest that lie at the four intersections of imaginary lines drawn to divide the composition into thirds, both horizontally and vertically.
    
    Many visual artists and photo professionals maintain that composition rules guide attention effectively and produce desired effects in most circumstances. The main subject is often placed off-center, at one of the intersections of the thirds, to avoid static effects. The RoT helps balance and structure the different elements of an image by establishing visual priorities among lines, shapes, colors, and textures, and it helps orchestrate viewer eye movement, encouraging exploration of the entire photograph.
    
    Although users of the RoT frequently accept these principles, little research has been done to test them. Some scholars suggest that artistic practices have merit and can serve as a good starting point for exploratory research. They argue that artists often recognize key visual principles before psychologists, acknowledging that the visual image results from the observer’s active perceptual activity.
    
Evidence shows that artistic rules can produce measurable effects. For instance, using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), one study found that the golden ratio produced the “desired effects.” Subjects exposed to a Greek statue in its original canonical form experienced strong feelings of beauty, while subjects viewing the same sculpture with altered proportions rated it as ugly, with the fMRI results supporting these subjective evaluations.
    Despite the RoT’s widespread use, relatively little research has explored its effects. Some studies have shown that the centrality of an image produces higher emotional intensity and valence, though they didn’t directly test if RoT composition or geometrical alignment produces such effects. Other research examined the detection of RoT presence as a marker of image aesthetics, quality, and object salience. Computer models have been found to approximate human perceptions of RoT images, though some studies suggest RoT may only play a minor role in aesthetic evaluations.
    
    Few studies have convincingly theorized why RoT may be an effective compositional rule or shown clear connections to human perceptions. Little research has tested whether RoT assists in human information processing by making central information more salient.
    
    This study argues that RoT composition will guide attention and ease the processing of primary visual content. Specifically, the RoT raises attention to the main subject, conveys crucial information through positioning, and enhances engagement through a higher perceived valence. In this way, RoT reduces the complexity of visual information by placing content within a geometrical structure that aligns with the human visual system.
    
    Vision: A System to Reduce Complexity
    The human visual system enables us to see, comprehend, and make sense of our surroundings. It is considered more effective and faster at processing audio-visual than verbal information. The visual system can stimulate behavior before the conscious mind becomes aware of it, and it is superior in processing complex information quickly. One glance at a complex visual scene can convey more information than words would, with greater fidelity. Research indicates that the visual system evolved as a tool for managing information and social complexity, supporting higher-order thinking and processing nuanced social information.
    
Although the visual system can handle complex sets of information, the absence of explicit guidelines, like syntactical and lexical rules in visual communication, complicates the transfer of exact information through images and videos. Neuroscientists and psychologists have shown that human vision operates by reducing complexity. For example, perception theory builds on the idea that the eyes are a direct extension of the brain into the environment. Perception is a complex process, driven largely by the unconscious emotional system, which helps us derive meaning from what we see.
    
    Visual cognition suggests that behavior, learning, and knowledge are direct responses to visual input. This process allows us to recognize shapes, objects, and scenes based on retinal input. Research on visual cognition focuses on the recognition of shapes and surfaces and how they are remembered or recalled. Geometrical shapes, surfaces, and redundancy are key elements in easing and speeding up the processing of visual input, and aesthetics also play a role in memory retention, as “good” figures are more likely to be remembered than “poor” ones.
    
However, visual information processing can be complicated by certain factors. Eye movements, which occur every 200 milliseconds, limit the visual system’s ability to store information for long periods. Perception can also be influenced by forward or backward masking, where one visual stimulus interferes with another. Additionally, emotions can bias visual perception. Given these cognitive limitations, a selection process must focus on the most crucial visual information for effective vision. Research shows that geometrical structures, such as those found in the Rule of Thirds (RoT) grid, can assist in this selection process by aligning content and guiding attention.
    
    Attention, a Guiding Principle for Vision
    Researchers describe attention as a type of selection process distinguishing relevant from irrelevant stimuli, which is required to process visual information. Tipper and Weaver suggest that the visual system relies on attention; without it, objects cannot be processed, nor recognized. Pylyshyn stresses the importance of the “focal attention as an interface between vision and cognition.” Attention, in other words, enhances specific spatial points or areas, which define or constitute particular objects. Specifically, attention heightens but also diminishes aspects of perception. Thus, attention operates like a filtering system that includes and excludes visual categories from the focus of awareness. Pylyshyn argues that the filtering process exists to prevent overloading of the visual system and to reduce interference on perception and cognition.
    
    Several researchers have suggested that attention is guided by specific patterns and symmetries of geometrical shapes that facilitate information processing. Uttal posits that “human visual systems are symmetry information-processing systems.” In other words, specific layouts of a scene or surface representations, that highlight the edges of surfaces, induce attention, making perception possible. Pylyshyn describes visual analysis or vision as
    “a highly complex informationprocessing system [that] individuates, or picks out, objects in a scene and computes the spatial layout of visible surfaces and the 3D shapes of the objects in the scene.”
    
    Marr conceptualizes the complexity of the visual process and cognition by defining vision from the user-centered perspective. His model, which converges the concepts of vision, attention and an even-spaced grid, specifically evokes the idea that the RoT may mimic the function of the human visual system on a rudimentary level. Marr describes vision as “a process that produces from images of the external world a description that is useful to the viewer and not cluttered with irrelevant information.” Marr’s model stresses that the filtering of information is achieved through geometrical structures that raise attention and accelerate the processing of the filtered visual information. Marr speaks of three different levels of analysis within the visual process, which all utilize geometrical structures akin to a coordinate system or a grid. The “primal sketch” provides important information about the two-dimensional sphere by detecting intensity changes and a geometrical distribution. The “2 ½-D sketch” highlights spatial relationships within a viewer centered coordinate frame. The last stage is the “3-D model representation” which changes the frame to an object centered coordinate frame to “describe shapes and their spatial organization.”
    
    While scholars point out that perception is not governed by specific laws, they agree on an underlying mechanism of attention, i.e., filtering visual information on the basis of geometrical structures that are spatially aligned. Attention can then be described as a process, which is guided by symmetry and geometrical structures that assist in the filtering of information and contribute to the ease of information processing within the complexity of visual cognition. The idea of the RoT as a geometrical structure that guides attention may then have merit. As a compositional tool RoT assists human vision by placing visual content on a grid, guiding the observer’s attention toward the most crucial visual information of an image. Thus, allowing for an easier, faster and less error prone processing of visual content. Following the rationale of these theoretical underpinnings, images that follow the RoT should make the focus of interest more accessible and easier to be understood. Thus, also making, among other aspects, the message and valence of an image more salient. Research shows that attention is closely connected to valence, which has been described as a form of cognition. Valence perceptions can thus be considered as an expression of information processing, reflecting a level of attention or how salient the main message of an image may be. We posit that measuring and comparing valence perceptions of images that are compliant and noncompliant with the RoT can thus indicate how the RoT aides image information processing.
    
  In summary, on the basis of these theoretical propositions, we posit that the RoT manipulates the visual structure of an image to raise attention, facilitating an easier visual analysis and understanding of a photograph. In order to examine this proposition, this study explores two research questions, which were deemed appropriate for this first-time research inquiry synthesizing and exploring these concepts. First, research has often argued that one of the critical aspects of understanding the narrative of an image is to perceive the valence (positive or negative) of the image as a form of information processing. Therefore, we explore whether ratings of the perceived valence of images are significantly affected by the compliance with the RoT.
    
    RQ1. Does the rule of thirds have a significant effect on the perceived valence of images?
    
    Another important aspect of image production is to place the main subject or focus of interest in such a way that it draws attention to the central information conveyed by the image. The literature on vision suggests that the RoT would help raise attention to the main subject of an image, which is arguably the starting point for perceiving the main information or narrative of an image. Thus, we sought to explore the 
    relationship between the perceived main subject of the image and compliance with the RoT.
    
    RQ2. Does the rule of thirds have a significant effect on the perceived main subject of images?
    
    Methodology
    Design
    In this experimental exploratory study, we employed a within-subjects 2 (valence type) × 2 (rule of thirds composition) × 2 (rule of thirds main subject) repeated-measures design. “Valence type” refers to the positive or negative (two levels) types of emotions of an image; “rule of thirds composition” indicates whether an image composition was in compliance with the RoT (two levels: “yes” and “no”); and the “rule of thirds main subject” referred to whether the main subject of the image was situated on one of the four RoT grid intersections (two levels: “yes” and “no”).
    
    Employing the repeated-measures design to test “perceived valence” and “perceived main subject of image” ensured stronger statistical power while also being economical, requiring fewer participants. The repeated measures design also made sense as the level of variability between participants across all images (that contain different characteristics of the independent variables) was low and the design allowed for a higher number of respondents to produce a given number of observations in contrast to other experimental designs that only match participants to one image or independent variable. Thus, due to the nature of the within-subjects experiment design the sample size was deemed appropriate. The 41 participants completing the study were each exposed to 24 different news images in random order (see below), making the total n = 984 for the experiment. For this research design, power analysis indicated that a total sample of 34 participants would be needed to detect large effects (d = .8) with 90% power using a t-test (with alpha at .05).
    
    Sample Population
    A total of 52 undergraduate students majoring in journalism were recruited from a large mid-Atlantic university in the United States via in-class announcements. Participants were told they would view images and answer a short set of questions for each image. In the recruitment phase, participants were also informed of the potentially graphic nature of some images based on the topics being portrayed and were given the option to decline participation. Under the instructors’ discretion, students who participated in the study received extra credit, or if choosing not to participate in the study, students were provided with an opportunity to complete a separate assignment for the same credit. Of the 52 students surveyed, 41, aged 19–25, completed the survey. Twenty-four participants were female (58.6%) and seventeen were male (41.4%).
    
    Material
    Twenty-four news images across six news topics were selected for this study. The six news topics were determined by surveying 25 university students in a pretest where they discussed perceived controversy levels of 20 news topics. The perceived controversial nature of the images was an important element for this study because we sought to understand how the respondents would perceive the valence (positive or negative) of the image differently based on various RoT conditions. In other words, we postulated that depicting controversial topics (pro vs con perspectives) would result in a distinct valence structure (positive or negative emotions). The following six topics received the most responses in the pretest, which we then selected for this study: drinking (healthy lifestyle vs binge drinking), gay marriage (pro vs con), Greek life (brother/sisterhood vs hazing), football (glory of sport vs injuries), U.S. troops abroad (fighting for our country vs mistreating prisoners), and President (pro vs con).
    
    Four news images for each news topic were selected using a Google image search of each topic followed by each word in parentheses above (e.g., “Greek life brotherhood/sisterhood” and “Greek life hazing”). Two images per story and per aspect (i.e., two positive/two negative) were selected randomly from the search results. The image orientation was not a factor in selection of photos for this study but the majority of images were horizontal while only two were vertical. The general Google image search was used deliberately to reflect the generic exposure to news images online. For the purpose of this experiment, we aimed to control perceived valence type by selecting images for all topics that tended in one valence direction (either positive or negative). For instance, negative images about gay marriage depicted only anti-gay marriage protesters holding disparaging signs and positive images depicted only happy (smiling) just-married gay couples. By the same token positive military images only showed smiling soldiers and negative images depicted scenes of a wounded soldier or abuse of a prisoner by a soldier. Using a wide range of topics allowed us to control for possible individual biases regarding a specific topic.
    
    In order to further ensure that our selection of images portray a valence direction (positive or negative) we conducted a manipulation check of the stimuli material. Ten photojournalism experts with expertise in both still photography and videography (professional photographers—including photojournalists at CNN, the White House Press Corps and the Baltimore Sun,—university educators or both) examined the selected images for compliance with the RoT. The experts also rated and determined the valence (as either positive or negative) of each image. Their comments about each image determined the main subject of each image, and the levels for each independent variable (“rule of thirds composition,” “rule of thirds main subject”), which was essential for coding the experiment survey data. In sum, we operationalized the experts’ opinion as the accurate understanding of the main subject, composition and the intended valence of each image (positive/negative).
    
Respondents’ answers were then coded as either “congruent with experts” opinion or “not congruent with experts” opinion. As a result, 15 out of the 24 images were identified as complying with the RoT in terms of composition, and 14 images as having main subjects complying with the RoT. In summary, out of 984 total cases, there were 492 per valence type (positive, negative); 615 following the RoT in terms of image composition; and 574 with the main subject following the RoT.
    
    Procedure
    Participants received a link to an online survey hosted by Qualtrics software. Upon activating the link, participants received brief instructions concerning the procedures and the option to withdraw at any time from the experiment. Then each of the 41 participants was shown the stimulus material (24 images) one image at a time, equaling 984 image views in total. In order to avoid potential carry over effects arising from the order of images shown, we randomized the image sequence for each participant. 
    
    After exposure to each image, participants had to fill out a three-question survey. The first question asked about the perceived valence of the image or how it made participants feel, using a 1–9 Likert scale (1 being “extremely negative” and 9 being “extremely positive”). The second and third questions asked participants to write down what they perceived as the main subject of the image and what they thought the story was, as could be told from the image. In the online survey, participants were not able to navigate back and forth from image to image. Participants took, on average, 42 minutes to complete the experiment. The completion time ranged from 23 to 57 minutes.
    
    Results
    Rule of Thirds and Perceived Valence
    In order to address the first research question—Does the rule of thirds have a significant effect on the perceived valence of images?—we tested whether participants perceived the direction of valence for an image 
    
    o each image’s predetermined valence (positive or negative). A one way ANOVA with mean values for perceived valence ratings for each image valence type (positive n1= 492; negative n2= 492) found that valence type of the image was a significant factor for the respondents’ perceived valence and its direction. Participants’ responses were highly skewed toward each end of the scale (1 and 9) in the direction of the predetermined (positive and negative) valence (M1= 6.82, SD= 1.38, M2= 3.09, SD= 1.66, F(1, 982) = 1473.80, p < .001).
    
    The distribution of images with a positive and negative valence in respect to RoT composition and main subject is not fully balanced. This imbalance is due to the Google search that we conducted, which aimed to reflect a wide variety of images, as they are found online. We took the conservative approach and tested if the unequal distribution may skew the valence perception. We ran several independent sample t-tests to examine if equality of variances is met. The Levene’s tests for equality of variances were not statistically significant indicating that the different groups’ variances are similar. Thus, the group size differences did not impact the analysis. Perceived valence scores were more negative when a negative valence image complied with the “rule of thirds composition” (M= 2.69, SD= 1.54) then if it did not (M= 4.27. SD= 1.45), t(490) = 9.98, p < .001, d = 1.05. A t-test between the positive valence groups also showed that participants perceived valence stronger when images complied with the rule n = 246 (M= 7.32, SD= 1.26) than if they did not n = 246 (M= 6.33, SD= 1.31), t(490) = 8.59, p < .001, d = .75.
    
    A t-test was also conducted to test the unequal group sizes for main subject RoT compliance and valence. Participants perceived higher positive valence when images complied with the RoT in respect to the main subject position n= 287 (M= 7.13, SD= 1.36) than when images did not have a main subject placed in the RoT grid n= 205 (M= 6.39, SD= 1.29), t(490) = 6.1, p < .001, d= .56. Another t-test confirmed the overall tendency that compliance with the RoT evokes stronger directional valence perceptions. Participants perceived images more negatively when the main subject was positioned in the RoT grid (M = 2.61, SD = 1.44) than if it wasn’t (M = 3.75, SD = 1.73), t(389) = 7.67, p < .001, 
    d = .71.
    
We also ran a number of ANOVAs to compare valence perceptions (positive and negative) in respect to the presence of the rules of thirds (i.e., RoT compliance/non-compliance) and whether the main subject was positioned in the RoT grid or not. All of the ANOVAs supported the t-test results. First, we compared positive valence perceptions of images compliant with the RoT with images that were non-compliant. Again, the presence of RoT composition showed that participants perceived an image as more positive (M1) than without RoT (M2) composition (M1= 7.32, SD= 1.26, M2= 6.33, SD= 1.31, F(1, 491) = 73.84, p < .001). We then repeated this step by comparing whether negative valence perceptions followed a similar pattern. Again, when images were compliant with the RoT, negative valence perception was more pronounced (M1) than without RoT (M2) compliance (M1= 2.69, SD= 1.54, M2= 4.27, SD= 1.45, F(1, 491) = 99.61, p < .001).
    
    Next, we examined if the valence perceptions were affected by the presence of the main subject (MS) in the RoT grid. Both the positive valence (M1= 7.13, SD= 1.36, M2= 6.39, SD= 1.29, F(1, 491) = 37.28, p < .001) and the negative valence (MS on RoT grid M1= 2.61, SD= 1.44, MS not on RoT grid M2= 3.75, SD= 1.73, F(1, 491) = 62.44, p < .001) were significantly more pronounced when the main subject was positioned on RoT grid than not.
    
    In order to see if the previous tendencies are robust, we further examined whether there were significant differences in the overall perceived valence ratings of the images (positive and negative combined) across the two RoT characteristics (composition, main subject). A two-way ANOVA was conducted to compare means of perceived valence for the two types of RoT characteristics. When RoT was followed for composition (n = 615), the average perceived valence rating was 4.59 (SD= 2.71), and 4.34 (SD= 2.57) when it was not (n= 369), showing a significantly different rating when the RoT for composition was followed, F(1, 983) = 64.87, p < .001. Similarly, RoT for the main subject was also a significant factor for differences in the overall perceived valence ratings. Compliance to RoT for main subject (n = 574) showed a mean of 6.59 (SD= 1.36) and non-compliance a mean of 5.37 (SD= 1.65). Differences were significant, F(1, 983) = 15.39, p < .001. We further examined the valence and RoT compliance by analyzing each type of RoT compliance. Differences in mean perceived valence were significantly higher when the RoT was not followed in terms of composition, but followed in terms of main subject (F(1, 983) = 6.55, p < .05). In other words, placing the main subject on the RoT grid proved to be
    a more significant indicator for differences in valence perception.
    
    Rule of Thirds and Identification 
    of Main Subject
    ANCOVA showed that only the RoT in terms of main subject was a significant factor for congruency of main subject identification. When the RoT was present for main subject (n= 573), the mean score for congruency was .59 (SD= .49) and when it was not present (n= 411), the mean score was significantly lower at .50 (SD= .50), F(1,
    983) = 11.43, p < .01. 
    
    Also, significant interactions were found for each type of RoT compliance. Differences of congruency between predetemined (expert based) main subject identification and respondents were significantly higher when the RoT was not followed in terms of composition, but followed in terms of main subject (F(1, 983) = 54.70, p < .001). Thus, the RoT
    compliance with regard to main subject yielded higher scores, making it easier for participants to identify the main subject . 
    
    Conclusion and Discussion
    This exploratory study took a first step to test possible effects of the RoT on participants’ perceptions of news images. We tested whether the RoT would make the main subject and the valence of a news photograph more salient. Our data analysis provides a tentative but promising indication that the RoT may be more than simply an aesthetical compositional tool; it appears to also assist in the information processing of visual stimuli. The results for both of our research questions—that explored whether the RoT has a significant effect on valence and main subject perception—suggest that participants’ perceptions were indeed guided by the RoT grid as they processed the visual information more accurately. The perceived valence of images was significantly higher when those images followed the RoT in their composition than when they didn’t. The differences for perceived valence were also higher when the main subject was positioned in the intersections of the RoT grid, than if it was not. This means that valence perception was stronger (more vivid) for images with the main subject complying with the RoT. In other words, participants were better able to correctly recognize the most important part of an image and as such an integral part of the narrative of the image.
    
    The RoT also aided the identification of the main subject. Our analysis of covariance showed that participants were more likely than not to identify the main subject when it was located in the RoT grid. The interaction effects that we found also pointed towards the importance of placing the main subject on the RoT grid. Valence was higher when the main subject was located on the RoT grid than when an image merely followed a “rule of thirds composition.” This indicates that the RoT could have significant effects in conveying the story of a picture more forcefully, making it more salient and easier to process.
    
    These findings are promising indicators that the RoT may ease information processing and as such has the potential to minimize possible errors in visual communication. Specifically, our findings suggest that the RoT could help avoid misidentifications of the main subject. The geometrical structures guide the process of vision by raising attention toward the focus of interest of an image, thereby filtering out irrelevant information. The process of visual cognition is guided by attention, which in turn is primarily triggered by the recognition of geometrical shapes and surfaces, symmetry, and spatial relationships. We argue that a similar process appears to facilitate the effectiveness of the RoT in establishing “visual priorities.”
    
    The significance of our results emphasizes the importance of the RoT for journalistic storytelling—not merely to raise attention, but also to effectively convey the focus point of an image. Images complying with the RoT can be considered more efficient in pointing toward relevant news content. But more specifically, when photojournalists have to choose between overall image composition or placing the main subject on to the RoT grid, they should favor the latter over the former to most effectively communicate visual content. The need to clearly communicate visual content is getting increasingly important as the consumption of visual news content continues to grow. Findings also indicate that in particular controversial news concerning social, political, or environmental issues would benefit from employing the RoT to emphasize the valence of an image, as increasing the emotional and/or affective salience of an image can facilitate greater engagement with the visual content.
    
Limitations and Prospects for Future Research
    Even though our study shows significant effects, there are a number of limitations that need to be addressed to move research on the RoT forward. First of all, there are no clear guidelines about the use and implementation of the RoT. This makes it very challenging to assess images, and even experienced 
    photojournalists and experts often disagree on whether a particular photo follows the rule or not. This also created some problems in our study since we designed our project to reflect the everyday news photo consumption experience online. The Google Image search did not provide us with an equal number of images that followed the RoT and those that did not comply with the compositional guideline. In a follow-up study, it would seem prudent to implement a series of tests 
    by using images that unmistakably abide by the RoT or to possibly use a machine vision analysis to help detect the presence of the RoT. At the same time, it would be greatly beneficial to control for other aspects of an image such as color, contrast, brightness, depth of field, object size, image orientation (vertical vs horizontal), and so on to clearly parse out the impact of the RoT on information processing and main information detection of an image. Such examinations would also allow us to investigate the perception of overall news photography quality in relation to the presence and absence of the RoT in order to tease out possible aesthetical effects.
    
    Moreover, our conceptualization of valence has some limitations because not all individuals may follow normative valence perceptions. In other words, some may evaluate distraught faces, abuse, or anger as positive rather than negative. Thus, our study cannot claim to universally describe, measure, or predict valence. In future studies, it would also be worthwhile to expand the research, using a larger population sample, and to test and control for political partisanship, attitudes, or other biases that may be influencing participants’ perceptions of controversial topics. The fact that we used an online experimental setting may also have influenced our findings, and it may be worthwhile to conduct a similar study in a more controlled environment. This study is just a first step in looking more closely at the significance of the RoT in conveying relevant information within journalistic storytelling. Much more needs to be done to understand this compositional rule and its effects on visual cognition, especially as images are becoming increasingly pivotal in the selection of news content and influential in the understanding of news.

    Evaluating the Rule of Thirds in Photographs 
    and Paintings <br><br>
    Seyed Ali Amirshahi , Gregor Uwe Hayn-Leichsenring, Joachim Denzler, and Christoph Redies<br><br>
    
    In 1797, John Thomas Smith proclaimed that the rule of thirds represents a more harmonizing proportion to follow in paintings of rural scenery than any other proportion. Ever since, the rule of thirds has been referred to as an important principle governing the spatial composition of aesthetic images. Although different descriptions have been given for the rule of thirds, most if not all of them suggest that, in order to create a photograph or painting of high aesthetic quality, the main object or focus point should be placed along one of the two imaginary horizontal or the two imaginary vertical lines that divide the image into nine equal parts (the third lines). For example, in his treatise, Smith advocated to fill the painting area by “two thirds of one element (as of water) to one third of another element (as of land),” rather than placing their border in the center of the painting.
    
    According to art critics and experts in photography, the rule of thirds is one of the most important composition rules used in painting and photography. In one version of the rule of thirds, the focus point in an image is placed along one of the third lines. In another version, the focus point is placed on one of the four intersections of the third lines. Photographs that follow the rule of thirds show the main focus point or object on or near the third lines or on their intersections. Photographs that do not follow the rule of thirds are also evident in contrast.
    
Others, for example, Arnheim in his study of compositional balance in images 
    of simple geometric forms, stressed the perceptual importance of the center of the image and the objects that it contains. Tyler reported a general tendency in art portraits that one of the eyes of the person depicted is centered along the midline in rectangular paintings. However, other researchers have found no evidence for such a bias. Palmer et al. reviewed some of the discrepancies between the on-center and off-center theories. They conducted a series of psychological experiments that confirmed the on-center bias, but only for forward-facing symmetrical objects; left-facing and right-facing objects tended to be located off-center. For vertically positioned objects, people preferred positions in the image that reflected spatial asymmetries in their functional properties and the typical position of the object relative to the observer. Moreover, Leyssen demonstrated that semantics plays a role in images containing two meaningful objects. Observers preferred images in which semantically related objects were close together and unrelated objects were far apart. McManus extended this type of investigation to other major axes in the rectangular frame of photographs. They critically evaluated Arnheim’s theory of visual balance and found no evidence to support it. Nevertheless, this and a previous study by the authors demonstrated that there are reproducible rules, according to which naive participants and experts reach aesthetic judgments on photographs.
    
    Some recent psychological studies provided precise physical definitions for concepts such as balance in images and investigated large numbers of images, but some of the earlier studies were less clear on how they measure image properties, or they based their results on a rather limited number of images. In the field of computational aesthetics, well-defined local and global physical properties were measured in large sets of images by modern digital image processing tools. However, the computational studies focused largely on simple, low-level features that can hardly explain the variability of aesthetic responses amongst humans or top-down cognitive processes involved in aesthetic judgments. Also, claims in computational aesthetics that the statistical properties relate to perceptual phenomena were sometimes not supported by data from rigorous psychological experiments. Therefore, a combination of both approaches is warranted to study the 
    
    determinants of individual preference.
    In computational aesthetics, an increasing amount of studies on the quality assessment of images and videos was published in the last few years. Recently, there has been a shift of interest towards the aesthetic quality assessment of paintings and photographs. Extracting multiple features from paintings and
    photographs is one of the common approaches taken in computational aesthetics. Most metrics share common features, for example, exposure of light, colorfulness, saturation, hue, aspect ratio, shape convexity, etc. Interestingly, the rule-of-thirds feature is amongst the features commonly used to assess the composition in paintings and photographs. For example, Datta et al. (2006) extracted 56 features and Li and Chen (2009)
    extracted 40 features from the image and used these features in their pooling  system system to come up with a score to assess the aesthetic quality of photographs and paintings based on subjective high-quality or low-quality ratings. In both metrics, the rule of thirds is used as a feature. An aspect common to both metrics is that the computations are restricted to the central window outlined by the third lines. The reasoning behind this selection was that objects positioned on one of the third lines tend to stretch toward the central point, and observers tend to focus on the center part of the painting.
    
    Mai and collaborators developed a computer-assisted method to predict whether a photograph respects the rule of thirds or not. They based their method on maps of saliency for each image. Saliency maps highlight image regions that are different from their surroundings and are calculated with the aim of predicting average looking behavior. Mai built a classifier that achieved around 80% accuracy in automatically detecting the rule of thirds in a photograph. Similar or related methods have been used in unsupervised cropping methods for digital photography. However, at present, the computer-based approaches cannot take into account semantic meaning, which also contributes to the appearance of image content as salient for human observers. Such top-down processing has an effect on looking behavior and, consequently, on the subjective assessment of whether an image obeys the rule of thirds.
    
There are many different ways of defining what may stick out in an image, and, consequently, there are many metrics to calculate saliency maps. In a recent survey of 35 such methods, researchers systematically studied their accuracy in predicting eye movements. Accuracy varied greatly between the different methods, depending on how accuracy was defined and the perceptual task involved (e.g., looking at synthetic versus natural images), but some methods consistently performed better than others. In the realm of art, eye movements were recorded in participants who viewed paintings from different Western art periods and compared the fixation maps with two different types of saliency maps. They found a high, but not perfect correlation between the saliency maps and the behavioral data. Similar results were obtained with a dataset of abstract and figurative paintings, and it was observed that the effect of saliency on eye fixations is short-lived.
    
    In the study by Mai, the authors did not correlate the performance of their automatic rule-of-thirds (ROT) classifier with subjective ROT ratings. It also remained unclear whether the photographs that followed the rule of thirds were perceived as more aesthetic. These issues will be addressed in the present study by comparing computed ROT values and subjective ROT rating scores. We also propose an algorithm that calculates ROT values in real-time without the need of training a classifier. 
    Three different methods for computing saliency were compared. As controls, we studied two additional datasets that do not follow the rule of thirds. Finally, we studied photographs that were rated as highly aesthetic by the users of a web-based photography forum, and artworks of Western provenance. We asked the following questions:
    
    (1) How well do the calculated ROT values correlate with subjective ROT scores?
    
    (2) How high are calculated ROT values for high-quality photographs and artists’ paintings of Western provenance? Do paintings differ in their values, depending on the content that is depicted in the paintings (abstract art, portraits, natural scenes or complex scenes with persons)?
    
    (3) Are photographs that follow the rule of thirds perceived as more aesthetic than those that do not?
    
    Material and Methods
    Image Datasets Used
    We used five different image datasets in our experiments to assess the performance of the proposed metrics and for evaluating the rule of thirds in paintings and photographs. Sample images from each image category are shown in Fig. 2.
    
    Rule-of-Thirds Photographs
This dataset consists of 679 photographs, which were randomly selected from a dataset of 2089 photographs that follow the rule of thirds and were collected by Mai. As a control, we randomly selected 403 photographs from a dataset of images by the same 
    authors that do not follow the rule of thirds. However, images were selected so that the mean values for the two groups matched approximately in terms of self-similarity, complexity, and anisotropy. Both types of images were gathered from the photo-sharing websites Flickr and Photo.net. Selection was based on the question of whether they did or did not follow the rule of thirds; whether the images were aesthetic or not, did not play a role in their selection, especially in the case of the photographs downloaded from the Flickr website. The two datasets do not share any images with the dataset.
    
    Photographs Taken Almost Randomly
    As another control, we analyzed a dataset of 606 photographs kindly provided by Prof. Chris McManus, University College, London. Image size was 2048 × 1536 pixels. The photographs were taken with a Canon Ixus 82 IS digital camera while the photographer was walking down streets or parks, sitting on buses or trains, in buildings, or other locations. The photographer made an explicit attempt to avoid pointing the camera at objects. Moreover, where possible, photographs were sampled at a regular interval to avoid a selection bias for particular objects or scenes. As a result, the photographs are examples of images that do not follow the rule of thirds. Sample photographs from the dataset are shown in Fig. 2k–o.
    
    Photographs of Simple Scenes of Objects
    This dataset consists of 200 photographs of simple (non-complex) scenes with one or only a few household and laboratory objects. The images were taken using a 15.1-megapixel digital camera (EOS 500D with EF-85 mm f/3.5–5.6 IS USM lens; Canon, Tokyo, Japan), as described previously. The main focus points of the images were the objects shown; the rule of thirds or other aesthetic criteria were not intentionally followed. Figure 2p–t represents sample images from this dataset. This database is available for public use through the website of our research group.
    
    High-Quality Photographs (Photo.net)
    This dataset consists of 200 photographs downloaded from the photo-sharing website Photo.net. The images were randomly selected from photographs that have an aesthetic rating of more than 5.5 out of a scale of 1 to 7. The ratings were given by the members of the website, that is, they were peer-reviewed by professional and amateur photographers. 
    
    Paintings
    This dataset consists of 727 paintings and comprises artworks of around 200 Western painters from a wide range of different centuries and a large variety of diverse art styles. The paintings were produced by well-known artists and collected by prestigious museums. The paintings were scanned from high-quality art books by our group using a calibrated digital scanner (Perfection 3200 Photo, Epson). To test whether the subject matter depicted in the paintings had an effect on the calculated ROT values, we classified the majority of the paintings based on their content. To reach reliable results, four categories of subject matter that contained large numbers of paintings were selected from the dataset. The categories were: abstract artworks (188 paintings), natural scenes (54 paintings), complex scenes with persons (151 paintings), and portraits (191 paintings).
    
Image Calculations
    Computational methods to study whether image composition complies with the rule of thirds have been proposed previously. As examples, we mentioned the studies by Datta and Li and Chen in the Introduction section. In the two studies, rule-of-thirds-related features are used as an input value in a pooling system that is designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of a painting or photograph. By themselves, these features cannot predict the overall aesthetic quality of an artwork.
    
    Mai calculated different features based on saliency maps and used them in a classifier to determine whether an image followed the rule of thirds or not. Saliency maps have been used in different image and video quality metrics as well as in the field of computational aesthetics. Extending the work by Mai and colleagues, we propose a simple, robust, and fast method to assess the rule of thirds. Unlike the previous approach, which is a supervised method, our method is unsupervised and does not require prior training of a classifier.
    
    Over the last few years, a number of different ways to calculate visual saliency maps have been proposed. In the present work, we employ three well-established metrics, which we refer to as the frequency-tuned (FT) method, the ITTI method, and the graph-based visual saliency (GBVS) method. In the FT method, the distance between the Lab pixel vector in a Gaussian-filtered image and the mean Lab vector for the image is calculated. The ITTI method is based on the use of the Gaussian blur filter. This filter is applied to the image in a pyramid manner and the difference between the original image and level 4 of the pyramid is calculated. The GBVS method takes the same approach as the ITTI method, but the calculations are done at higher levels.
    
    In the proposed approach, we first calculated the saliency map for each image. The previous methods by Datta and Li and Chen were based on calculating mean values over a central region in the original image in separate color channels in the HSV and HSL color space. In the present study, we determined the maximum sum of saliency over four different regions that were related to the rule of thirds. Two approaches for selecting the regions of interest were followed. In the first approach, we used four boxes that were each centered on one of the intersections of the third lines  as the regions of interest. In the second approach, we introduced four stripes that were each centered on one of the third lines. The stripes and the boxes had a width and height that corresponded to 10%, 16% or 20% of the width and height of the image, respectively. Next, we calculated the mean saliency value for each of the four regions and then took the maximum value as a measure for the saliency placed on the third lines. For details of the calculations, see the Supplementary Appendix.
    
    Initially, we calculated stripes and boxes with different widths for all three saliency methods (FT, ITTI and GBVS). Because the GBVS method with boxes of a 16% width gave the best correlations with subjective ratings of the degree to which an image followed the rule of thirds, this combination of parameters was used for the rest of the study.
    
    To investigate whether saliency maps can be used to evaluate the existence of the rule of thirds, we measured the mean saliency over all images in each dataset introduced above. For each image, saliency maps were normalized to sum up to 1. To calculate the mean saliency map for each image category, we first resized each image in the category to 1024 × 1024 pixels so that the saliency maps of all images could be added to one another on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The result was then divided by the number of images in each category.
    
 Rating Experiments
    Participants
    Twenty participants between 19 and 41 years (mean age: 26.8 ± 5.9 SD, nine males) rated the aesthetics of presented images (Experiment 1). 
    Ten other participants between 22 and 33 years (mean age: 26.1 ± 3.4 SD, four males) estimated the degree to which the images followed the rule of thirds.
    
    Stimuli
    We used the dataset described in who separated the dataset into a subset of photographs that follow the rule of thirds, and a subset that does not obey the rule of thirds. From each subset, we randomly selected 100 images (200 images in total). The majority of photographs were color images, but grayscale images were also used. To achieve a consistent display on the screen, we reduced the size of all images to 800 pixels on the longer side. Smaller images were shown at their original size. In Experiment 2, we drew thin white lines on the images to indicate the third lines. All images were presented with a maximum size of 20.5 cm (longest side) on a computer 
    
    screen. Participants viewed stimuli from a distance of 90 cm (assured by a chin rest). Hence, images covered a maximum of 13° of the visual angle.
    
    Experiment 1: Rating of Aesthetic Appearance
    First, we showed ten example images for 2 s each to get the participants acquainted with the database. Then, participants were asked to rate the images according to their aesthetics on a mouse-based scale. The scale for the aesthetics rating was from 0 to 1 and continuous (100 steps, not visible to the participants) and endpoints were labeled with ‘not aesthetic’ and ‘aesthetic’, respectively (or the German equivalent to those terms). There was no time restriction. After response by clicking on the scale, the next image appeared. The 200 stimuli were presented separately and in random order on a black screen. Before each image appeared on the screen, the cursor of the mouse was 
    set to the midpoint of the scale.
    
    Experiment 2: Rating of the Presence of the Rule of Thirds
    First, we showed the participants three sample images. One of the images followed the rule of thirds based on the fact that the focus of interest was placed along one of the third lines. Another image followed the rule of thirds based on the fact that the focus of interest was on one of the intersections of the third lines. The third image did not follow the rule of thirds. In the experiment, ten example images were shown for 2 s to introduce the database. Then, participants were asked to evaluate by mouse click whether or not the focus point of the images was on one of the third lines or, in another round, on one of the four intersections of the third lines. The participants were asked to choose between the left (‘no’) and the right side (‘yes’) of a scale. They also had the option of selecting intermediate positions on the scale so that they could indicate the degree to which an image followed the rule of thirds. There was no time restriction. After the response, the next image appeared. The 200 stimuli were presented separately and in random order on the black screen. Five participants evaluated the third lines first and the other five participants evaluated the intersection points first.
    
 Subjective Rule-of-Thirds (ROT) Rating
    As a baseline for this study, we first asked ten participants to rate the degree to which 200 photographs followed the ROT. In separate sessions, participants evaluated two different ROT criteria that are commonly used. In one session, they assessed whether the focus of interest was on one of the third lines. In another session, they assessed whether the focus of interest was on one of the intersections of the third lines. For the rating, we selected 100 images that followed the ROT (here called ROT+ images) and 100 images that did not follow it (ROT− images) from the dataset.
    
    For the rating based on the intersections, the ROT+ photographs received an average score of 0.76 ± 0.17 SD on a continuous scale from 0 to 1. As expected, the average score of ROT− photographs was much lower (0.23 ± 0.22 SD; p < 0.0001, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test; Cohen’s d = 2.71). The corresponding scores for the rating based on the third lines were 0.62 ± 0.22 SD and 0.35 ± 0.23 SD, respectively (p < 0.0001; d = 1.21).
    
    Calculation of Saliency-Based ROT Measure
    Next, we calculated saliency-based ROT values for the three methods (GBVS, ITTI and FS) with different parameters and asked which paradigm yielded the highest correlations with the subjective ROT ratings. The same 200 photographs were used as described in Section 3.1. Results indicate that the highest correlations were obtained for the GBVS method with boxes of 16% width placed on the intersections of the third lines. For this metric, Fig. 3 shows a dot plot of the subjective ROT rating versus the calculated ROT measure. Largely confirming the initial classification, the majority of ROT− images (blue dots in Fig. 3) received not only low scores for subjective ROT ratings (see above) but also low values calculated for ROT (mean 0.069 ± 0.016 SD). 
    In contrast, the ROT values calculated for the ROT+ images (red squares in Fig. 3), which received high subjective ROT scores, scattered more widely at a much higher level (mean 0.109 ± 0.058 SD; p < 0.0001, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test; d = 0.94). While the subjective ROT scores did not correlate with the calculated ROT values for the ROT− images, we found a moderate correlation between the two measures for the ROT+ images (red regression line in Fig. 3).
    
    Because the GBVS metric resulted in the highest overall correlation between calculated ROT values and subjective ROT scores, we used this metric in the rest of the study. This choice was in agreement with a recent survey of 35 saliency metrics, in which the GBVS method outperformed most of the other methods in eye movement prediction accuracy.
    
    We also compared the subjective ROT scores with the ROT values that were calculated with the methods introduced by Datta and Li and Chen. However, no correlation was found. We conclude that the two metrics do not help us in distinguishing between images that follow or do not follow the rule of thirds in our dataset of images.
    In the majority of images, the 
    
    positions of high saliency values (yellow to red color) correspond to subjective focus points of interest.
     Confirming similar results, the average saliency map for the ROT+ images shows highest saliency values in the box that is centered on the lower right intersection of the third lines, but also relatively high values at the other intersections. By contrast, saliency is highest in the center of the ROT− photographs. A similar central peak of saliency is observed for the photographs of scenes taken almost randomly, the simple scenes of objects, and the high-quality photographs. For the entire painting dataset, there is a central tendency for high saliency values, but peak saliency is shifted slightly towards the upper left corner. A separate analysis for the different categories of paintings reveals that this shift is especially prominent in portraits. The position of this peak may relate to the tendency of artists to place the faces, which are highly salient, into the upper regions of the paintings where they are close to or covered by the third lines. Average saliency in the other categories of painting categories is more evenly distributed across the images.
    
    The above results were quantified by calculating the saliency values with the GBVS method (boxes overlying intersections, 16% width) for each image separately. The results confirm that the ROT+ images have higher mean saliency values (0.102 ± 0.053 SD) than the ROT− photographs (0.067 ± 0.016 SD); p < 0.001; d = 0.90) as well as all the other image categories (for all other comparisons, p < 0.001, Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison test; d = 0.73 to 1.73). Among the paintings, portraits have higher values (0.068 ± 0.016 SD) than abstract images (0.059 ± 0.018 SD; p < 0.001, d = 0.46) and complex scenes with persons (0.061 ± 0.013 SD; p < 0.001, d = 0.55).
    Subjective Rating of Beauty
    In the last part of this study, participants rated the aesthetics of the 100 ROT+ photographs and 100 ROT− photographs that had been previously assessed for the degree to which they complied with the rule of thirds. The mean aesthetic rating score for the ROT+ images (0.59 ± 0.14 SD) was slightly higher than that of the ROT− images (0.54 ± 0.14 SD; p < 0.01, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test, d = 0.36). Aesthetic rating scores were plotted as a function of the subjective ROT scores and the calculated ROT values. There was a weak overall correlation between the aesthetic rating score and the subjective ROT rating score (Spearman ρ = 0.17, p < 0.05). However, the aesthetic rating score did not correlate significantly with the calculated ROT measure.
    
    Discussion
    Computational versus Behavioral Measures for the Rule of Thirds
    We used three different saliency metrics to calculate two rule-of-third (ROT) measures and validated the results in comparison with subjective data from participants who rated the degree to which photographs followed the rule of thirds in a psychological experiment. Compared to the other methods, the GBVS metrics with boxes centered on the intersections of the third lines yielded the strongest correlations between the computed data and the subjective scores. The GBVS method was shown previously to be an outstanding metric to predict looking behavior in a comparative study of saliency methods.
    
    Overall, the correlation between computed ROT values and behavioral scores was of intermediate strength (Spearman ρ = 0.47). For photographs that did not follow the rule of thirds on subjective grounds (ROT− images), low calculated ROT values were obtained on average. The two control databases, which had not been generated to comply with the rule of thirds (almost random photographs and simple scenes of objects) also yielded low calculated ROT values. 
    By contrast, average calculated ROT values were much higher for photographs that were rated as concordant with the rule of thirds in the present study (ROT+ images). However, computed values scattered widely and the correlation with the subjective ROT scores was relatively weak (Spearman ρ = 0.31). Therefore, we conclude that factors other than saliency are likely to contribute to subjective ROT ratings. Presumably, top-down mechanisms that take the semantics of a photograph into account are amongst the most relevant factors. A similar combination of bottom-up (saliency-based) and top-down (cognitive) mechanisms has been invoked in the prediction of eye movements. In conclusion, we demonstrate that low-level visual saliency contributes to the perception of the rule of thirds in photographs in a bottom-up fashion.
    
    Strikingly, the mean saliency maps demonstrate that peak saliency in the rule-of-thirds (ROT+) photographs is not evenly distributed across the boxes overlying the four intersections of the third lines. Instead, they are concentrated in the lower left box. It remains to be investigated whether this observation is unique to the dataset analyzed in the present study, corresponds to a more general tendency by photographers, or reflects other compositional rules.
    
    The present results corroborate the study by Mai et al., which achieved 
    a 72–80% classification rate of photographs that followed the rule of thirds versus photographs that did not. However, unlike the study by Mai et al., the method proposed by us does not require any prior training of a classifier. It represents an automated tool that instantly delivers a single measure, which can contribute to the question of whether a photograph complies with the rule of thirds. As such, practicing artists or photographers may use this method in isolation during their work. A robust, fast and reliable method for measuring the ROT feature might be valuable also for research in the field of experimental aesthetics. 
    
    Correlation of Aesthetic Ratings with Rule-of-Thirds Judgments and Measures
    The rule of thirds is a feature that is widely used to assess the aesthetic quality of paintings and photographs. In the present study, we challenged the validity of this approach by relating aesthetic rating scores to ROT rating scores for a dataset of 200 photographs. The two scores correlated only weakly (Spearman ρ = 0.17). Moreover, there was no correlation between the aesthetic rating score and the calculated ROT measure. The mean calculated ROT values for aesthetic photographs were only slightly higher than those of control photographs that do not follow the rule of thirds. These results suggest that the rule of thirds plays only a minor, if any, role in the aesthetic evaluation of photographs.
    
    ROT Values Computed for Paintings
    Low calculated ROT values were also observed for the dataset of paintings. However, we did not obtain subjective rating scores for the aesthetic value of the paintings. Nevertheless, curators of prestigious art museums considered their acquisition worthwhile, probably because of the superior artistic quality of the paintings. Also, we did not rate the degree to which the paintings followed the rule of thirds. Nevertheless, the low calculated ROT values for paintings suggest that the rule of thirds, at least as far as it is based on saliency-based mechanisms, is not a decisive factor for determining the visual quality of the paintings.
    
    Mean saliency maps for portrait paintings showed a prominent peak close to the upper left box. This peak likely corresponds to the average position of the faces in portrait paintings. It results in relatively high saliency values close to the upper left ROT box and, consequently, leads to slightly higher calculated ROT values. Average saliency in the other categories of paintings is more evenly distributed and mean saliency values are about as low as in photographs that do not follow the rule of thirds.
    
    Conclusions
    In summary, our findings suggest that the rule of thirds might not be as important for the evaluation of the visual quality in photographs and artworks as previously assumed. Evidently, not following this rule does not necessarily result in images of low visual quality. We can only speculate why the rule of thirds plays such an important role in textbooks on photography and art. Perhaps, like the golden section, the rule of thirds mirrors the desire of artists and photographers to comprehend rules of artistic composition. Therefore, it might have become a normative aspect of creating artworks rather than a qualitative one. The rule of thirds may also help beginners to endow the products of their creativity with a particular visual structure under conscious control. Eventually, as artists gain intuitive expertise in artistic composition, they may drop the rule, which might be the reason why we did not find it in high-quality photographs and artworks.

                    Introduction
              The rule of thirds (RoT), in art and photography, refers to making use of the intersections of four imaginary lines that divide an image into thirds, horizontally and vertically, to alter the composition of an image. Although many people may not be aware of the term “rule of thirds,” they may very well apply it on a daily basis when taking pictures with their mobile devices. Digital cameras and camera apps normally have a RoT grid option to assist the user in taking a photograph. Most photo editing software also provide a RoT layer to guide the cropping process of a picture. Virtually any book on learning photography will discuss the RoT. One of the goals of employing the RoT is to compose an aesthetically pleasing and balanced image composition but also to position the most important information within the image in such a way as to communicate it saliently, thereby increasing the probability of a more accurate identification
    of the most important information of an image. 
    
    The RoT as a guiding principle of image composition and image perception
    is especially relevant in the digital news media environment, with its increasing emphasis on visual culture. Visual news has been predicted to be replacing text-based news as the main source of information. Photos and videos are and continue to be important in the online communication economy on social media as well as in political communication and participation. In fact, news consumers increasingly share and consume visual information. For instance, over the past few years, the consumption of online news videos alone doubled across several countries in the Americas and Europe.
    
    The proliferation of visual information has a number of implications for the production and perception of visual news content. On the one hand, the demand for images as an essential tool for journalistic storytelling created a demand for multimedia skills to produce professional high-quality visual content. Students in video and photography classes, including in the U.S., 
    where this study was conducted, learn using RoT in order to improve the composition of an image (while abiding by journalistic principles and ethics). Possessing such a skill has been deemed to be one of the differences between visual content produced by professional journalists and amateurs.
    
On the other hand, a shift toward more visual content may impact the way users, readers, and audiences perceive information and news. Scholars speak of a visual primacy effect that highlights the salience of visual cues over verbal ones. Empirical research shows that visual cues can overshadow textual information or carry biases such as in political news coverage, environmental news, conflict coverage, but also on social media. People have the tendency—at least on Facebook—to form impressions about others primarily based on their profile photos, rather than on the verbal self-disclosures that accompany these images.
    
    The proliferation of visual information and the dominance of visual over textual information, as described by the visual primacy effect, indicate the need to improve the creation of visual information such as photographs. The RoT may be able to assist in this process by making the focus point of an image more salient and thus reducing the probability of information processing errors. Yet, despite the ubiquity of visual content and wide use of the RoT as a decision-making tool for composition, research has not expansively explored the effectiveness of the RoT as a way to guide attention within visual communication. This exploratory study attempts to fill this gap in research by theorizing and testing the RoT as a geometrical structure that assists the processing of visual information.
    
    Literature Review
    The Rule of Thirds: Practice and Theory
    Since the fifteenth century, artists have been using the Rule of Thirds (RoT) to make certain crucial parts of an image more salient. Specifically, the RoT is used to determine areas of interest that lie at the four intersections of imaginary lines drawn to divide the composition into thirds, both horizontally and vertically.
    
    Many visual artists and photo professionals maintain that composition rules guide attention effectively and produce desired effects in most circumstances. The main subject is often placed off-center, at one of the intersections of the thirds, to avoid static effects. The RoT helps balance and structure the different elements of an image by establishing visual priorities among lines, shapes, colors, and textures, and it helps orchestrate viewer eye movement, encouraging exploration of the entire photograph.
    
    Although users of the RoT frequently accept these principles, little research has been done to test them. Some scholars suggest that artistic practices have merit and can serve as a good starting point for exploratory research. They argue that artists often recognize key visual principles before psychologists, acknowledging that the visual image results from the observer’s active perceptual activity.
    
Evidence shows that artistic rules can produce measurable effects. For instance, using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), one study found that the golden ratio produced the “desired effects.” Subjects exposed to a Greek statue in its original canonical form experienced strong feelings of beauty, while subjects viewing the same sculpture with altered proportions rated it as ugly, with the fMRI results supporting these subjective evaluations.
    Despite the RoT’s widespread use, relatively little research has explored its effects. Some studies have shown that the centrality of an image produces higher emotional intensity and valence, though they didn’t directly test if RoT composition or geometrical alignment produces such effects. Other research examined the detection of RoT presence as a marker of image aesthetics, quality, and object salience. Computer models have been found to approximate human perceptions of RoT images, though some studies suggest RoT may only play a minor role in aesthetic evaluations.
    
    Few studies have convincingly theorized why RoT may be an effective compositional rule or shown clear connections to human perceptions. Little research has tested whether RoT assists in human information processing by making central information more salient.
    
    This study argues that RoT composition will guide attention and ease the processing of primary visual content. Specifically, the RoT raises attention to the main subject, conveys crucial information through positioning, and enhances engagement through a higher perceived valence. In this way, RoT reduces the complexity of visual information by placing content within a geometrical structure that aligns with the human visual system.
    
    Vision: A System to Reduce Complexity
    The human visual system enables us to see, comprehend, and make sense of our surroundings. It is considered more effective and faster at processing audio-visual than verbal information. The visual system can stimulate behavior before the conscious mind becomes aware of it, and it is superior in processing complex information quickly. One glance at a complex visual scene can convey more information than words would, with greater fidelity. Research indicates that the visual system evolved as a tool for managing information and social complexity, supporting higher-order thinking and processing nuanced social information.
    
Although the visual system can handle complex sets of information, the absence of explicit guidelines, like syntactical and lexical rules in visual communication, complicates the transfer of exact information through images and videos. Neuroscientists and psychologists have shown that human vision operates by reducing complexity. For example, perception theory builds on the idea that the eyes are a direct extension of the brain into the environment. Perception is a complex process, driven largely by the unconscious emotional system, which helps us derive meaning from what we see.
    
    Visual cognition suggests that behavior, learning, and knowledge are direct responses to visual input. This process allows us to recognize shapes, objects, and scenes based on retinal input. Research on visual cognition focuses on the recognition of shapes and surfaces and how they are remembered or recalled. Geometrical shapes, surfaces, and redundancy are key elements in easing and speeding up the processing of visual input, and aesthetics also play a role in memory retention, as “good” figures are more likely to be remembered than “poor” ones.
    
However, visual information processing can be complicated by certain factors. Eye movements, which occur every 200 milliseconds, limit the visual system’s ability to store information for long periods. Perception can also be influenced by forward or backward masking, where one visual stimulus interferes with another. Additionally, emotions can bias visual perception. Given these cognitive limitations, a selection process must focus on the most crucial visual information for effective vision. Research shows that geometrical structures, such as those found in the Rule of Thirds (RoT) grid, can assist in this selection process by aligning content and guiding attention.
    
    Attention, a Guiding Principle for Vision
    Researchers describe attention as a type of selection process distinguishing relevant from irrelevant stimuli, which is required to process visual information. Tipper and Weaver suggest that the visual system relies on attention; without it, objects cannot be processed, nor recognized. Pylyshyn stresses the importance of the “focal attention as an interface between vision and cognition.” Attention, in other words, enhances specific spatial points or areas, which define or constitute particular objects. Specifically, attention heightens but also diminishes aspects of perception. Thus, attention operates like a filtering system that includes and excludes visual categories from the focus of awareness. Pylyshyn argues that the filtering process exists to prevent overloading of the visual system and to reduce interference on perception and cognition.
    
    Several researchers have suggested that attention is guided by specific patterns and symmetries of geometrical shapes that facilitate information processing. Uttal posits that “human visual systems are symmetry information-processing systems.” In other words, specific layouts of a scene or surface representations, that highlight the edges of surfaces, induce attention, making perception possible. Pylyshyn describes visual analysis or vision as
    “a highly complex informationprocessing system [that] individuates, or picks out, objects in a scene and computes the spatial layout of visible surfaces and the 3D shapes of the objects in the scene.”
    
    Marr conceptualizes the complexity of the visual process and cognition by defining vision from the user-centered perspective. His model, which converges the concepts of vision, attention and an even-spaced grid, specifically evokes the idea that the RoT may mimic the function of the human visual system on a rudimentary level. Marr describes vision as “a process that produces from images of the external world a description that is useful to the viewer and not cluttered with irrelevant information.” Marr’s model stresses that the filtering of information is achieved through geometrical structures that raise attention and accelerate the processing of the filtered visual information. Marr speaks of three different levels of analysis within the visual process, which all utilize geometrical structures akin to a coordinate system or a grid. The “primal sketch” provides important information about the two-dimensional sphere by detecting intensity changes and a geometrical distribution. The “2 ½-D sketch” highlights spatial relationships within a viewer centered coordinate frame. The last stage is the “3-D model representation” which changes the frame to an object centered coordinate frame to “describe shapes and their spatial organization.”
    
    While scholars point out that perception is not governed by specific laws, they agree on an underlying mechanism of attention, i.e., filtering visual information on the basis of geometrical structures that are spatially aligned. Attention can then be described as a process, which is guided by symmetry and geometrical structures that assist in the filtering of information and contribute to the ease of information processing within the complexity of visual cognition. The idea of the RoT as a geometrical structure that guides attention may then have merit. As a compositional tool RoT assists human vision by placing visual content on a grid, guiding the observer’s attention toward the most crucial visual information of an image. Thus, allowing for an easier, faster and less error prone processing of visual content. Following the rationale of these theoretical underpinnings, images that follow the RoT should make the focus of interest more accessible and easier to be understood. Thus, also making, among other aspects, the message and valence of an image more salient. Research shows that attention is closely connected to valence, which has been described as a form of cognition. Valence perceptions can thus be considered as an expression of information processing, reflecting a level of attention or how salient the main message of an image may be. We posit that measuring and comparing valence perceptions of images that are compliant and noncompliant with the RoT can thus indicate how the RoT aides image information processing.
    
  In summary, on the basis of these theoretical propositions, we posit that the RoT manipulates the visual structure of an image to raise attention, facilitating an easier visual analysis and understanding of a photograph. In order to examine this proposition, this study explores two research questions, which were deemed appropriate for this first-time research inquiry synthesizing and exploring these concepts. First, research has often argued that one of the critical aspects of understanding the narrative of an image is to perceive the valence (positive or negative) of the image as a form of information processing. Therefore, we explore whether ratings of the perceived valence of images are significantly affected by the compliance with the RoT.
    
    RQ1. Does the rule of thirds have a significant effect on the perceived valence of images?
    
    Another important aspect of image production is to place the main subject or focus of interest in such a way that it draws attention to the central information conveyed by the image. The literature on vision suggests that the RoT would help raise attention to the main subject of an image, which is arguably the starting point for perceiving the main information or narrative of an image. Thus, we sought to explore the 
    relationship between the perceived main subject of the image and compliance with the RoT.
    
    RQ2. Does the rule of thirds have a significant effect on the perceived main subject of images?
    
    Methodology
    Design
    In this experimental exploratory study, we employed a within-subjects 2 (valence type) × 2 (rule of thirds composition) × 2 (rule of thirds main subject) repeated-measures design. “Valence type” refers to the positive or negative (two levels) types of emotions of an image; “rule of thirds composition” indicates whether an image composition was in compliance with the RoT (two levels: “yes” and “no”); and the “rule of thirds main subject” referred to whether the main subject of the image was situated on one of the four RoT grid intersections (two levels: “yes” and “no”).
    
    Employing the repeated-measures design to test “perceived valence” and “perceived main subject of image” ensured stronger statistical power while also being economical, requiring fewer participants. The repeated measures design also made sense as the level of variability between participants across all images (that contain different characteristics of the independent variables) was low and the design allowed for a higher number of respondents to produce a given number of observations in contrast to other experimental designs that only match participants to one image or independent variable. Thus, due to the nature of the within-subjects experiment design the sample size was deemed appropriate. The 41 participants completing the study were each exposed to 24 different news images in random order (see below), making the total n = 984 for the experiment. For this research design, power analysis indicated that a total sample of 34 participants would be needed to detect large effects (d = .8) with 90% power using a t-test (with alpha at .05).
    
    Sample Population
    A total of 52 undergraduate students majoring in journalism were recruited from a large mid-Atlantic university in the United States via in-class announcements. Participants were told they would view images and answer a short set of questions for each image. In the recruitment phase, participants were also informed of the potentially graphic nature of some images based on the topics being portrayed and were given the option to decline participation. Under the instructors’ discretion, students who participated in the study received extra credit, or if choosing not to participate in the study, students were provided with an opportunity to complete a separate assignment for the same credit. Of the 52 students surveyed, 41, aged 19–25, completed the survey. Twenty-four participants were female (58.6%) and seventeen were male (41.4%).
    
    Material
    Twenty-four news images across six news topics were selected for this study. The six news topics were determined by surveying 25 university students in a pretest where they discussed perceived controversy levels of 20 news topics. The perceived controversial nature of the images was an important element for this study because we sought to understand how the respondents would perceive the valence (positive or negative) of the image differently based on various RoT conditions. In other words, we postulated that depicting controversial topics (pro vs con perspectives) would result in a distinct valence structure (positive or negative emotions). The following six topics received the most responses in the pretest, which we then selected for this study: drinking (healthy lifestyle vs binge drinking), gay marriage (pro vs con), Greek life (brother/sisterhood vs hazing), football (glory of sport vs injuries), U.S. troops abroad (fighting for our country vs mistreating prisoners), and President (pro vs con).
    
    Four news images for each news topic were selected using a Google image search of each topic followed by each word in parentheses above (e.g., “Greek life brotherhood/sisterhood” and “Greek life hazing”). Two images per story and per aspect (i.e., two positive/two negative) were selected randomly from the search results. The image orientation was not a factor in selection of photos for this study but the majority of images were horizontal while only two were vertical. The general Google image search was used deliberately to reflect the generic exposure to news images online. For the purpose of this experiment, we aimed to control perceived valence type by selecting images for all topics that tended in one valence direction (either positive or negative). For instance, negative images about gay marriage depicted only anti-gay marriage protesters holding disparaging signs and positive images depicted only happy (smiling) just-married gay couples. By the same token positive military images only showed smiling soldiers and negative images depicted scenes of a wounded soldier or abuse of a prisoner by a soldier. Using a wide range of topics allowed us to control for possible individual biases regarding a specific topic.
    
    In order to further ensure that our selection of images portray a valence direction (positive or negative) we conducted a manipulation check of the stimuli material. Ten photojournalism experts with expertise in both still photography and videography (professional photographers—including photojournalists at CNN, the White House Press Corps and the Baltimore Sun,—university educators or both) examined the selected images for compliance with the RoT. The experts also rated and determined the valence (as either positive or negative) of each image. Their comments about each image determined the main subject of each image, and the levels for each independent variable (“rule of thirds composition,” “rule of thirds main subject”), which was essential for coding the experiment survey data. In sum, we operationalized the experts’ opinion as the accurate understanding of the main subject, composition and the intended valence of each image (positive/negative).
    
Respondents’ answers were then coded as either “congruent with experts” opinion or “not congruent with experts” opinion. As a result, 15 out of the 24 images were identified as complying with the RoT in terms of composition, and 14 images as having main subjects complying with the RoT. In summary, out of 984 total cases, there were 492 per valence type (positive, negative); 615 following the RoT in terms of image composition; and 574 with the main subject following the RoT.
    
    Procedure
    Participants received a link to an online survey hosted by Qualtrics software. Upon activating the link, participants received brief instructions concerning the procedures and the option to withdraw at any time from the experiment. Then each of the 41 participants was shown the stimulus material (24 images) one image at a time, equaling 984 image views in total. In order to avoid potential carry over effects arising from the order of images shown, we randomized the image sequence for each participant. 
    
    After exposure to each image, participants had to fill out a three-question survey. The first question asked about the perceived valence of the image or how it made participants feel, using a 1–9 Likert scale (1 being “extremely negative” and 9 being “extremely positive”). The second and third questions asked participants to write down what they perceived as the main subject of the image and what they thought the story was, as could be told from the image. In the online survey, participants were not able to navigate back and forth from image to image. Participants took, on average, 42 minutes to complete the experiment. The completion time ranged from 23 to 57 minutes.
    
    Results
    Rule of Thirds and Perceived Valence
    In order to address the first research question—Does the rule of thirds have a significant effect on the perceived valence of images?—we tested whether participants perceived the direction of valence for an image 
    
    o each image’s predetermined valence (positive or negative). A one way ANOVA with mean values for perceived valence ratings for each image valence type (positive n1= 492; negative n2= 492) found that valence type of the image was a significant factor for the respondents’ perceived valence and its direction. Participants’ responses were highly skewed toward each end of the scale (1 and 9) in the direction of the predetermined (positive and negative) valence (M1= 6.82, SD= 1.38, M2= 3.09, SD= 1.66, F(1, 982) = 1473.80, p < .001).
    
    The distribution of images with a positive and negative valence in respect to RoT composition and main subject is not fully balanced. This imbalance is due to the Google search that we conducted, which aimed to reflect a wide variety of images, as they are found online. We took the conservative approach and tested if the unequal distribution may skew the valence perception. We ran several independent sample t-tests to examine if equality of variances is met. The Levene’s tests for equality of variances were not statistically significant indicating that the different groups’ variances are similar. Thus, the group size differences did not impact the analysis. Perceived valence scores were more negative when a negative valence image complied with the “rule of thirds composition” (M= 2.69, SD= 1.54) then if it did not (M= 4.27. SD= 1.45), t(490) = 9.98, p < .001, d = 1.05. A t-test between the positive valence groups also showed that participants perceived valence stronger when images complied with the rule n = 246 (M= 7.32, SD= 1.26) than if they did not n = 246 (M= 6.33, SD= 1.31), t(490) = 8.59, p < .001, d = .75.
    
    A t-test was also conducted to test the unequal group sizes for main subject RoT compliance and valence. Participants perceived higher positive valence when images complied with the RoT in respect to the main subject position n= 287 (M= 7.13, SD= 1.36) than when images did not have a main subject placed in the RoT grid n= 205 (M= 6.39, SD= 1.29), t(490) = 6.1, p < .001, d= .56. Another t-test confirmed the overall tendency that compliance with the RoT evokes stronger directional valence perceptions. Participants perceived images more negatively when the main subject was positioned in the RoT grid (M = 2.61, SD = 1.44) than if it wasn’t (M = 3.75, SD = 1.73), t(389) = 7.67, p < .001, 
    d = .71.
    
We also ran a number of ANOVAs to compare valence perceptions (positive and negative) in respect to the presence of the rules of thirds (i.e., RoT compliance/non-compliance) and whether the main subject was positioned in the RoT grid or not. All of the ANOVAs supported the t-test results. First, we compared positive valence perceptions of images compliant with the RoT with images that were non-compliant. Again, the presence of RoT composition showed that participants perceived an image as more positive (M1) than without RoT (M2) composition (M1= 7.32, SD= 1.26, M2= 6.33, SD= 1.31, F(1, 491) = 73.84, p < .001). We then repeated this step by comparing whether negative valence perceptions followed a similar pattern. Again, when images were compliant with the RoT, negative valence perception was more pronounced (M1) than without RoT (M2) compliance (M1= 2.69, SD= 1.54, M2= 4.27, SD= 1.45, F(1, 491) = 99.61, p < .001).
    
    Next, we examined if the valence perceptions were affected by the presence of the main subject (MS) in the RoT grid. Both the positive valence (M1= 7.13, SD= 1.36, M2= 6.39, SD= 1.29, F(1, 491) = 37.28, p < .001) and the negative valence (MS on RoT grid M1= 2.61, SD= 1.44, MS not on RoT grid M2= 3.75, SD= 1.73, F(1, 491) = 62.44, p < .001) were significantly more pronounced when the main subject was positioned on RoT grid than not.
    
    In order to see if the previous tendencies are robust, we further examined whether there were significant differences in the overall perceived valence ratings of the images (positive and negative combined) across the two RoT characteristics (composition, main subject). A two-way ANOVA was conducted to compare means of perceived valence for the two types of RoT characteristics. When RoT was followed for composition (n = 615), the average perceived valence rating was 4.59 (SD= 2.71), and 4.34 (SD= 2.57) when it was not (n= 369), showing a significantly different rating when the RoT for composition was followed, F(1, 983) = 64.87, p < .001. Similarly, RoT for the main subject was also a significant factor for differences in the overall perceived valence ratings. Compliance to RoT for main subject (n = 574) showed a mean of 6.59 (SD= 1.36) and non-compliance a mean of 5.37 (SD= 1.65). Differences were significant, F(1, 983) = 15.39, p < .001. We further examined the valence and RoT compliance by analyzing each type of RoT compliance. Differences in mean perceived valence were significantly higher when the RoT was not followed in terms of composition, but followed in terms of main subject (F(1, 983) = 6.55, p < .05). In other words, placing the main subject on the RoT grid proved to be
    a more significant indicator for differences in valence perception.
    
    Rule of Thirds and Identification 
    of Main Subject
    ANCOVA showed that only the RoT in terms of main subject was a significant factor for congruency of main subject identification. When the RoT was present for main subject (n= 573), the mean score for congruency was .59 (SD= .49) and when it was not present (n= 411), the mean score was significantly lower at .50 (SD= .50), F(1,
    983) = 11.43, p < .01. 
    
    Also, significant interactions were found for each type of RoT compliance. Differences of congruency between predetemined (expert based) main subject identification and respondents were significantly higher when the RoT was not followed in terms of composition, but followed in terms of main subject (F(1, 983) = 54.70, p < .001). Thus, the RoT
    compliance with regard to main subject yielded higher scores, making it easier for participants to identify the main subject . 
    
    Conclusion and Discussion
    This exploratory study took a first step to test possible effects of the RoT on participants’ perceptions of news images. We tested whether the RoT would make the main subject and the valence of a news photograph more salient. Our data analysis provides a tentative but promising indication that the RoT may be more than simply an aesthetical compositional tool; it appears to also assist in the information processing of visual stimuli. The results for both of our research questions—that explored whether the RoT has a significant effect on valence and main subject perception—suggest that participants’ perceptions were indeed guided by the RoT grid as they processed the visual information more accurately. The perceived valence of images was significantly higher when those images followed the RoT in their composition than when they didn’t. The differences for perceived valence were also higher when the main subject was positioned in the intersections of the RoT grid, than if it was not. This means that valence perception was stronger (more vivid) for images with the main subject complying with the RoT. In other words, participants were better able to correctly recognize the most important part of an image and as such an integral part of the narrative of the image.
    
    The RoT also aided the identification of the main subject. Our analysis of covariance showed that participants were more likely than not to identify the main subject when it was located in the RoT grid. The interaction effects that we found also pointed towards the importance of placing the main subject on the RoT grid. Valence was higher when the main subject was located on the RoT grid than when an image merely followed a “rule of thirds composition.” This indicates that the RoT could have significant effects in conveying the story of a picture more forcefully, making it more salient and easier to process.
    
    These findings are promising indicators that the RoT may ease information processing and as such has the potential to minimize possible errors in visual communication. Specifically, our findings suggest that the RoT could help avoid misidentifications of the main subject. The geometrical structures guide the process of vision by raising attention toward the focus of interest of an image, thereby filtering out irrelevant information. The process of visual cognition is guided by attention, which in turn is primarily triggered by the recognition of geometrical shapes and surfaces, symmetry, and spatial relationships. We argue that a similar process appears to facilitate the effectiveness of the RoT in establishing “visual priorities.”
    
    The significance of our results emphasizes the importance of the RoT for journalistic storytelling—not merely to raise attention, but also to effectively convey the focus point of an image. Images complying with the RoT can be considered more efficient in pointing toward relevant news content. But more specifically, when photojournalists have to choose between overall image composition or placing the main subject on to the RoT grid, they should favor the latter over the former to most effectively communicate visual content. The need to clearly communicate visual content is getting increasingly important as the consumption of visual news content continues to grow. Findings also indicate that in particular controversial news concerning social, political, or environmental issues would benefit from employing the RoT to emphasize the valence of an image, as increasing the emotional and/or affective salience of an image can facilitate greater engagement with the visual content.
    
Limitations and Prospects for Future Research
    Even though our study shows significant effects, there are a number of limitations that need to be addressed to move research on the RoT forward. First of all, there are no clear guidelines about the use and implementation of the RoT. This makes it very challenging to assess images, and even experienced 
    photojournalists and experts often disagree on whether a particular photo follows the rule or not. This also created some problems in our study since we designed our project to reflect the everyday news photo consumption experience online. The Google Image search did not provide us with an equal number of images that followed the RoT and those that did not comply with the compositional guideline. In a follow-up study, it would seem prudent to implement a series of tests 
    by using images that unmistakably abide by the RoT or to possibly use a machine vision analysis to help detect the presence of the RoT. At the same time, it would be greatly beneficial to control for other aspects of an image such as color, contrast, brightness, depth of field, object size, image orientation (vertical vs horizontal), and so on to clearly parse out the impact of the RoT on information processing and main information detection of an image. Such examinations would also allow us to investigate the perception of overall news photography quality in relation to the presence and absence of the RoT in order to tease out possible aesthetical effects.
    
    Moreover, our conceptualization of valence has some limitations because not all individuals may follow normative valence perceptions. In other words, some may evaluate distraught faces, abuse, or anger as positive rather than negative. Thus, our study cannot claim to universally describe, measure, or predict valence. In future studies, it would also be worthwhile to expand the research, using a larger population sample, and to test and control for political partisanship, attitudes, or other biases that may be influencing participants’ perceptions of controversial topics. The fact that we used an online experimental setting may also have influenced our findings, and it may be worthwhile to conduct a similar study in a more controlled environment. This study is just a first step in looking more closely at the significance of the RoT in conveying relevant information within journalistic storytelling. Much more needs to be done to understand this compositional rule and its effects on visual cognition, especially as images are becoming increasingly pivotal in the selection of news content and influential in the understanding of news.

    Evaluating the Rule of Thirds in Photographs 
    and Paintings <br><br>
    Seyed Ali Amirshahi , Gregor Uwe Hayn-Leichsenring, Joachim Denzler, and Christoph Redies<br><br>
    
    In 1797, John Thomas Smith proclaimed that the rule of thirds represents a more harmonizing proportion to follow in paintings of rural scenery than any other proportion. Ever since, the rule of thirds has been referred to as an important principle governing the spatial composition of aesthetic images. Although different descriptions have been given for the rule of thirds, most if not all of them suggest that, in order to create a photograph or painting of high aesthetic quality, the main object or focus point should be placed along one of the two imaginary horizontal or the two imaginary vertical lines that divide the image into nine equal parts (the third lines). For example, in his treatise, Smith advocated to fill the painting area by “two thirds of one element (as of water) to one third of another element (as of land),” rather than placing their border in the center of the painting.
    
    According to art critics and experts in photography, the rule of thirds is one of the most important composition rules used in painting and photography. In one version of the rule of thirds, the focus point in an image is placed along one of the third lines. In another version, the focus point is placed on one of the four intersections of the third lines. Photographs that follow the rule of thirds show the main focus point or object on or near the third lines or on their intersections. Photographs that do not follow the rule of thirds are also evident in contrast.
    
Others, for example, Arnheim in his study of compositional balance in images 
    of simple geometric forms, stressed the perceptual importance of the center of the image and the objects that it contains. Tyler reported a general tendency in art portraits that one of the eyes of the person depicted is centered along the midline in rectangular paintings. However, other researchers have found no evidence for such a bias. Palmer et al. reviewed some of the discrepancies between the on-center and off-center theories. They conducted a series of psychological experiments that confirmed the on-center bias, but only for forward-facing symmetrical objects; left-facing and right-facing objects tended to be located off-center. For vertically positioned objects, people preferred positions in the image that reflected spatial asymmetries in their functional properties and the typical position of the object relative to the observer. Moreover, Leyssen demonstrated that semantics plays a role in images containing two meaningful objects. Observers preferred images in which semantically related objects were close together and unrelated objects were far apart. McManus extended this type of investigation to other major axes in the rectangular frame of photographs. They critically evaluated Arnheim’s theory of visual balance and found no evidence to support it. Nevertheless, this and a previous study by the authors demonstrated that there are reproducible rules, according to which naive participants and experts reach aesthetic judgments on photographs.
    
    Some recent psychological studies provided precise physical definitions for concepts such as balance in images and investigated large numbers of images, but some of the earlier studies were less clear on how they measure image properties, or they based their results on a rather limited number of images. In the field of computational aesthetics, well-defined local and global physical properties were measured in large sets of images by modern digital image processing tools. However, the computational studies focused largely on simple, low-level features that can hardly explain the variability of aesthetic responses amongst humans or top-down cognitive processes involved in aesthetic judgments. Also, claims in computational aesthetics that the statistical properties relate to perceptual phenomena were sometimes not supported by data from rigorous psychological experiments. Therefore, a combination of both approaches is warranted to study the 
    
    determinants of individual preference.
    In computational aesthetics, an increasing amount of studies on the quality assessment of images and videos was published in the last few years. Recently, there has been a shift of interest towards the aesthetic quality assessment of paintings and photographs. Extracting multiple features from paintings and
    photographs is one of the common approaches taken in computational aesthetics. Most metrics share common features, for example, exposure of light, colorfulness, saturation, hue, aspect ratio, shape convexity, etc. Interestingly, the rule-of-thirds feature is amongst the features commonly used to assess the composition in paintings and photographs. For example, Datta et al. (2006) extracted 56 features and Li and Chen (2009)
    extracted 40 features from the image and used these features in their pooling  system system to come up with a score to assess the aesthetic quality of photographs and paintings based on subjective high-quality or low-quality ratings. In both metrics, the rule of thirds is used as a feature. An aspect common to both metrics is that the computations are restricted to the central window outlined by the third lines. The reasoning behind this selection was that objects positioned on one of the third lines tend to stretch toward the central point, and observers tend to focus on the center part of the painting.
    
    Mai and collaborators developed a computer-assisted method to predict whether a photograph respects the rule of thirds or not. They based their method on maps of saliency for each image. Saliency maps highlight image regions that are different from their surroundings and are calculated with the aim of predicting average looking behavior. Mai built a classifier that achieved around 80% accuracy in automatically detecting the rule of thirds in a photograph. Similar or related methods have been used in unsupervised cropping methods for digital photography. However, at present, the computer-based approaches cannot take into account semantic meaning, which also contributes to the appearance of image content as salient for human observers. Such top-down processing has an effect on looking behavior and, consequently, on the subjective assessment of whether an image obeys the rule of thirds.
    
There are many different ways of defining what may stick out in an image, and, consequently, there are many metrics to calculate saliency maps. In a recent survey of 35 such methods, researchers systematically studied their accuracy in predicting eye movements. Accuracy varied greatly between the different methods, depending on how accuracy was defined and the perceptual task involved (e.g., looking at synthetic versus natural images), but some methods consistently performed better than others. In the realm of art, eye movements were recorded in participants who viewed paintings from different Western art periods and compared the fixation maps with two different types of saliency maps. They found a high, but not perfect correlation between the saliency maps and the behavioral data. Similar results were obtained with a dataset of abstract and figurative paintings, and it was observed that the effect of saliency on eye fixations is short-lived.
    
    In the study by Mai, the authors did not correlate the performance of their automatic rule-of-thirds (ROT) classifier with subjective ROT ratings. It also remained unclear whether the photographs that followed the rule of thirds were perceived as more aesthetic. These issues will be addressed in the present study by comparing computed ROT values and subjective ROT rating scores. We also propose an algorithm that calculates ROT values in real-time without the need of training a classifier. 
    Three different methods for computing saliency were compared. As controls, we studied two additional datasets that do not follow the rule of thirds. Finally, we studied photographs that were rated as highly aesthetic by the users of a web-based photography forum, and artworks of Western provenance. We asked the following questions:
    
    (1) How well do the calculated ROT values correlate with subjective ROT scores?
    
    (2) How high are calculated ROT values for high-quality photographs and artists’ paintings of Western provenance? Do paintings differ in their values, depending on the content that is depicted in the paintings (abstract art, portraits, natural scenes or complex scenes with persons)?
    
    (3) Are photographs that follow the rule of thirds perceived as more aesthetic than those that do not?
    
    Material and Methods
    Image Datasets Used
    We used five different image datasets in our experiments to assess the performance of the proposed metrics and for evaluating the rule of thirds in paintings and photographs. Sample images from each image category are shown in Fig. 2.
    
    Rule-of-Thirds Photographs
This dataset consists of 679 photographs, which were randomly selected from a dataset of 2089 photographs that follow the rule of thirds and were collected by Mai. As a control, we randomly selected 403 photographs from a dataset of images by the same 
    authors that do not follow the rule of thirds. However, images were selected so that the mean values for the two groups matched approximately in terms of self-similarity, complexity, and anisotropy. Both types of images were gathered from the photo-sharing websites Flickr and Photo.net. Selection was based on the question of whether they did or did not follow the rule of thirds; whether the images were aesthetic or not, did not play a role in their selection, especially in the case of the photographs downloaded from the Flickr website. The two datasets do not share any images with the dataset.
    
    Photographs Taken Almost Randomly
    As another control, we analyzed a dataset of 606 photographs kindly provided by Prof. Chris McManus, University College, London. Image size was 2048 × 1536 pixels. The photographs were taken with a Canon Ixus 82 IS digital camera while the photographer was walking down streets or parks, sitting on buses or trains, in buildings, or other locations. The photographer made an explicit attempt to avoid pointing the camera at objects. Moreover, where possible, photographs were sampled at a regular interval to avoid a selection bias for particular objects or scenes. As a result, the photographs are examples of images that do not follow the rule of thirds. Sample photographs from the dataset are shown in Fig. 2k–o.
    
    Photographs of Simple Scenes of Objects
    This dataset consists of 200 photographs of simple (non-complex) scenes with one or only a few household and laboratory objects. The images were taken using a 15.1-megapixel digital camera (EOS 500D with EF-85 mm f/3.5–5.6 IS USM lens; Canon, Tokyo, Japan), as described previously. The main focus points of the images were the objects shown; the rule of thirds or other aesthetic criteria were not intentionally followed. Figure 2p–t represents sample images from this dataset. This database is available for public use through the website of our research group.
    
    High-Quality Photographs (Photo.net)
    This dataset consists of 200 photographs downloaded from the photo-sharing website Photo.net. The images were randomly selected from photographs that have an aesthetic rating of more than 5.5 out of a scale of 1 to 7. The ratings were given by the members of the website, that is, they were peer-reviewed by professional and amateur photographers. 
    
    Paintings
    This dataset consists of 727 paintings and comprises artworks of around 200 Western painters from a wide range of different centuries and a large variety of diverse art styles. The paintings were produced by well-known artists and collected by prestigious museums. The paintings were scanned from high-quality art books by our group using a calibrated digital scanner (Perfection 3200 Photo, Epson). To test whether the subject matter depicted in the paintings had an effect on the calculated ROT values, we classified the majority of the paintings based on their content. To reach reliable results, four categories of subject matter that contained large numbers of paintings were selected from the dataset. The categories were: abstract artworks (188 paintings), natural scenes (54 paintings), complex scenes with persons (151 paintings), and portraits (191 paintings).
    
Image Calculations
    Computational methods to study whether image composition complies with the rule of thirds have been proposed previously. As examples, we mentioned the studies by Datta and Li and Chen in the Introduction section. In the two studies, rule-of-thirds-related features are used as an input value in a pooling system that is designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of a painting or photograph. By themselves, these features cannot predict the overall aesthetic quality of an artwork.
    
    Mai calculated different features based on saliency maps and used them in a classifier to determine whether an image followed the rule of thirds or not. Saliency maps have been used in different image and video quality metrics as well as in the field of computational aesthetics. Extending the work by Mai and colleagues, we propose a simple, robust, and fast method to assess the rule of thirds. Unlike the previous approach, which is a supervised method, our method is unsupervised and does not require prior training of a classifier.
    
    Over the last few years, a number of different ways to calculate visual saliency maps have been proposed. In the present work, we employ three well-established metrics, which we refer to as the frequency-tuned (FT) method, the ITTI method, and the graph-based visual saliency (GBVS) method. In the FT method, the distance between the Lab pixel vector in a Gaussian-filtered image and the mean Lab vector for the image is calculated. The ITTI method is based on the use of the Gaussian blur filter. This filter is applied to the image in a pyramid manner and the difference between the original image and level 4 of the pyramid is calculated. The GBVS method takes the same approach as the ITTI method, but the calculations are done at higher levels.
    
    In the proposed approach, we first calculated the saliency map for each image. The previous methods by Datta and Li and Chen were based on calculating mean values over a central region in the original image in separate color channels in the HSV and HSL color space. In the present study, we determined the maximum sum of saliency over four different regions that were related to the rule of thirds. Two approaches for selecting the regions of interest were followed. In the first approach, we used four boxes that were each centered on one of the intersections of the third lines  as the regions of interest. In the second approach, we introduced four stripes that were each centered on one of the third lines. The stripes and the boxes had a width and height that corresponded to 10%, 16% or 20% of the width and height of the image, respectively. Next, we calculated the mean saliency value for each of the four regions and then took the maximum value as a measure for the saliency placed on the third lines. For details of the calculations, see the Supplementary Appendix.
    
    Initially, we calculated stripes and boxes with different widths for all three saliency methods (FT, ITTI and GBVS). Because the GBVS method with boxes of a 16% width gave the best correlations with subjective ratings of the degree to which an image followed the rule of thirds, this combination of parameters was used for the rest of the study.
    
    To investigate whether saliency maps can be used to evaluate the existence of the rule of thirds, we measured the mean saliency over all images in each dataset introduced above. For each image, saliency maps were normalized to sum up to 1. To calculate the mean saliency map for each image category, we first resized each image in the category to 1024 × 1024 pixels so that the saliency maps of all images could be added to one another on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The result was then divided by the number of images in each category.
    
 Rating Experiments
    Participants
    Twenty participants between 19 and 41 years (mean age: 26.8 ± 5.9 SD, nine males) rated the aesthetics of presented images (Experiment 1). 
    Ten other participants between 22 and 33 years (mean age: 26.1 ± 3.4 SD, four males) estimated the degree to which the images followed the rule of thirds.
    
    Stimuli
    We used the dataset described in who separated the dataset into a subset of photographs that follow the rule of thirds, and a subset that does not obey the rule of thirds. From each subset, we randomly selected 100 images (200 images in total). The majority of photographs were color images, but grayscale images were also used. To achieve a consistent display on the screen, we reduced the size of all images to 800 pixels on the longer side. Smaller images were shown at their original size. In Experiment 2, we drew thin white lines on the images to indicate the third lines. All images were presented with a maximum size of 20.5 cm (longest side) on a computer 
    
    screen. Participants viewed stimuli from a distance of 90 cm (assured by a chin rest). Hence, images covered a maximum of 13° of the visual angle.
    
    Experiment 1: Rating of Aesthetic Appearance
    First, we showed ten example images for 2 s each to get the participants acquainted with the database. Then, participants were asked to rate the images according to their aesthetics on a mouse-based scale. The scale for the aesthetics rating was from 0 to 1 and continuous (100 steps, not visible to the participants) and endpoints were labeled with ‘not aesthetic’ and ‘aesthetic’, respectively (or the German equivalent to those terms). There was no time restriction. After response by clicking on the scale, the next image appeared. The 200 stimuli were presented separately and in random order on a black screen. Before each image appeared on the screen, the cursor of the mouse was 
    set to the midpoint of the scale.
    
    Experiment 2: Rating of the Presence of the Rule of Thirds
    First, we showed the participants three sample images. One of the images followed the rule of thirds based on the fact that the focus of interest was placed along one of the third lines. Another image followed the rule of thirds based on the fact that the focus of interest was on one of the intersections of the third lines. The third image did not follow the rule of thirds. In the experiment, ten example images were shown for 2 s to introduce the database. Then, participants were asked to evaluate by mouse click whether or not the focus point of the images was on one of the third lines or, in another round, on one of the four intersections of the third lines. The participants were asked to choose between the left (‘no’) and the right side (‘yes’) of a scale. They also had the option of selecting intermediate positions on the scale so that they could indicate the degree to which an image followed the rule of thirds. There was no time restriction. After the response, the next image appeared. The 200 stimuli were presented separately and in random order on the black screen. Five participants evaluated the third lines first and the other five participants evaluated the intersection points first.
    
 Subjective Rule-of-Thirds (ROT) Rating
    As a baseline for this study, we first asked ten participants to rate the degree to which 200 photographs followed the ROT. In separate sessions, participants evaluated two different ROT criteria that are commonly used. In one session, they assessed whether the focus of interest was on one of the third lines. In another session, they assessed whether the focus of interest was on one of the intersections of the third lines. For the rating, we selected 100 images that followed the ROT (here called ROT+ images) and 100 images that did not follow it (ROT− images) from the dataset.
    
    For the rating based on the intersections, the ROT+ photographs received an average score of 0.76 ± 0.17 SD on a continuous scale from 0 to 1. As expected, the average score of ROT− photographs was much lower (0.23 ± 0.22 SD; p < 0.0001, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test; Cohen’s d = 2.71). The corresponding scores for the rating based on the third lines were 0.62 ± 0.22 SD and 0.35 ± 0.23 SD, respectively (p < 0.0001; d = 1.21).
    
    Calculation of Saliency-Based ROT Measure
    Next, we calculated saliency-based ROT values for the three methods (GBVS, ITTI and FS) with different parameters and asked which paradigm yielded the highest correlations with the subjective ROT ratings. The same 200 photographs were used as described in Section 3.1. Results indicate that the highest correlations were obtained for the GBVS method with boxes of 16% width placed on the intersections of the third lines. For this metric, Fig. 3 shows a dot plot of the subjective ROT rating versus the calculated ROT measure. Largely confirming the initial classification, the majority of ROT− images (blue dots in Fig. 3) received not only low scores for subjective ROT ratings (see above) but also low values calculated for ROT (mean 0.069 ± 0.016 SD). 
    In contrast, the ROT values calculated for the ROT+ images (red squares in Fig. 3), which received high subjective ROT scores, scattered more widely at a much higher level (mean 0.109 ± 0.058 SD; p < 0.0001, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test; d = 0.94). While the subjective ROT scores did not correlate with the calculated ROT values for the ROT− images, we found a moderate correlation between the two measures for the ROT+ images (red regression line in Fig. 3).
    
    Because the GBVS metric resulted in the highest overall correlation between calculated ROT values and subjective ROT scores, we used this metric in the rest of the study. This choice was in agreement with a recent survey of 35 saliency metrics, in which the GBVS method outperformed most of the other methods in eye movement prediction accuracy.
    
    We also compared the subjective ROT scores with the ROT values that were calculated with the methods introduced by Datta and Li and Chen. However, no correlation was found. We conclude that the two metrics do not help us in distinguishing between images that follow or do not follow the rule of thirds in our dataset of images.
    In the majority of images, the 
    
    positions of high saliency values (yellow to red color) correspond to subjective focus points of interest.
     Confirming similar results, the average saliency map for the ROT+ images shows highest saliency values in the box that is centered on the lower right intersection of the third lines, but also relatively high values at the other intersections. By contrast, saliency is highest in the center of the ROT− photographs. A similar central peak of saliency is observed for the photographs of scenes taken almost randomly, the simple scenes of objects, and the high-quality photographs. For the entire painting dataset, there is a central tendency for high saliency values, but peak saliency is shifted slightly towards the upper left corner. A separate analysis for the different categories of paintings reveals that this shift is especially prominent in portraits. The position of this peak may relate to the tendency of artists to place the faces, which are highly salient, into the upper regions of the paintings where they are close to or covered by the third lines. Average saliency in the other categories of painting categories is more evenly distributed across the images.
    
    The above results were quantified by calculating the saliency values with the GBVS method (boxes overlying intersections, 16% width) for each image separately. The results confirm that the ROT+ images have higher mean saliency values (0.102 ± 0.053 SD) than the ROT− photographs (0.067 ± 0.016 SD); p < 0.001; d = 0.90) as well as all the other image categories (for all other comparisons, p < 0.001, Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison test; d = 0.73 to 1.73). Among the paintings, portraits have higher values (0.068 ± 0.016 SD) than abstract images (0.059 ± 0.018 SD; p < 0.001, d = 0.46) and complex scenes with persons (0.061 ± 0.013 SD; p < 0.001, d = 0.55).
    Subjective Rating of Beauty
    In the last part of this study, participants rated the aesthetics of the 100 ROT+ photographs and 100 ROT− photographs that had been previously assessed for the degree to which they complied with the rule of thirds. The mean aesthetic rating score for the ROT+ images (0.59 ± 0.14 SD) was slightly higher than that of the ROT− images (0.54 ± 0.14 SD; p < 0.01, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test, d = 0.36). Aesthetic rating scores were plotted as a function of the subjective ROT scores and the calculated ROT values. There was a weak overall correlation between the aesthetic rating score and the subjective ROT rating score (Spearman ρ = 0.17, p < 0.05). However, the aesthetic rating score did not correlate significantly with the calculated ROT measure.
    
    Discussion
    Computational versus Behavioral Measures for the Rule of Thirds
    We used three different saliency metrics to calculate two rule-of-third (ROT) measures and validated the results in comparison with subjective data from participants who rated the degree to which photographs followed the rule of thirds in a psychological experiment. Compared to the other methods, the GBVS metrics with boxes centered on the intersections of the third lines yielded the strongest correlations between the computed data and the subjective scores. The GBVS method was shown previously to be an outstanding metric to predict looking behavior in a comparative study of saliency methods.
    
    Overall, the correlation between computed ROT values and behavioral scores was of intermediate strength (Spearman ρ = 0.47). For photographs that did not follow the rule of thirds on subjective grounds (ROT− images), low calculated ROT values were obtained on average. The two control databases, which had not been generated to comply with the rule of thirds (almost random photographs and simple scenes of objects) also yielded low calculated ROT values. 
    By contrast, average calculated ROT values were much higher for photographs that were rated as concordant with the rule of thirds in the present study (ROT+ images). However, computed values scattered widely and the correlation with the subjective ROT scores was relatively weak (Spearman ρ = 0.31). Therefore, we conclude that factors other than saliency are likely to contribute to subjective ROT ratings. Presumably, top-down mechanisms that take the semantics of a photograph into account are amongst the most relevant factors. A similar combination of bottom-up (saliency-based) and top-down (cognitive) mechanisms has been invoked in the prediction of eye movements. In conclusion, we demonstrate that low-level visual saliency contributes to the perception of the rule of thirds in photographs in a bottom-up fashion.
    
    Strikingly, the mean saliency maps demonstrate that peak saliency in the rule-of-thirds (ROT+) photographs is not evenly distributed across the boxes overlying the four intersections of the third lines. Instead, they are concentrated in the lower left box. It remains to be investigated whether this observation is unique to the dataset analyzed in the present study, corresponds to a more general tendency by photographers, or reflects other compositional rules.
    
    The present results corroborate the study by Mai et al., which achieved 
    a 72–80% classification rate of photographs that followed the rule of thirds versus photographs that did not. However, unlike the study by Mai et al., the method proposed by us does not require any prior training of a classifier. It represents an automated tool that instantly delivers a single measure, which can contribute to the question of whether a photograph complies with the rule of thirds. As such, practicing artists or photographers may use this method in isolation during their work. A robust, fast and reliable method for measuring the ROT feature might be valuable also for research in the field of experimental aesthetics. 
    
    Correlation of Aesthetic Ratings with Rule-of-Thirds Judgments and Measures
    The rule of thirds is a feature that is widely used to assess the aesthetic quality of paintings and photographs. In the present study, we challenged the validity of this approach by relating aesthetic rating scores to ROT rating scores for a dataset of 200 photographs. The two scores correlated only weakly (Spearman ρ = 0.17). Moreover, there was no correlation between the aesthetic rating score and the calculated ROT measure. The mean calculated ROT values for aesthetic photographs were only slightly higher than those of control photographs that do not follow the rule of thirds. These results suggest that the rule of thirds plays only a minor, if any, role in the aesthetic evaluation of photographs.
    
    ROT Values Computed for Paintings
    Low calculated ROT values were also observed for the dataset of paintings. However, we did not obtain subjective rating scores for the aesthetic value of the paintings. Nevertheless, curators of prestigious art museums considered their acquisition worthwhile, probably because of the superior artistic quality of the paintings. Also, we did not rate the degree to which the paintings followed the rule of thirds. Nevertheless, the low calculated ROT values for paintings suggest that the rule of thirds, at least as far as it is based on saliency-based mechanisms, is not a decisive factor for determining the visual quality of the paintings.
    
    Mean saliency maps for portrait paintings showed a prominent peak close to the upper left box. This peak likely corresponds to the average position of the faces in portrait paintings. It results in relatively high saliency values close to the upper left ROT box and, consequently, leads to slightly higher calculated ROT values. Average saliency in the other categories of paintings is more evenly distributed and mean saliency values are about as low as in photographs that do not follow the rule of thirds.
    
    Conclusions
    In summary, our findings suggest that the rule of thirds might not be as important for the evaluation of the visual quality in photographs and artworks as previously assumed. Evidently, not following this rule does not necessarily result in images of low visual quality. We can only speculate why the rule of thirds plays such an important role in textbooks on photography and art. Perhaps, like the golden section, the rule of thirds mirrors the desire of artists and photographers to comprehend rules of artistic composition. Therefore, it might have become a normative aspect of creating artworks rather than a qualitative one. The rule of thirds may also help beginners to endow the products of their creativity with a particular visual structure under conscious control. Eventually, as artists gain intuitive expertise in artistic composition, they may drop the rule, which might be the reason why we did not find it in high-quality photographs and artworks.

                    Introduction
              The rule of thirds (RoT), in art and photography, refers to making use of the intersections of four imaginary lines that divide an image into thirds, horizontally and vertically, to alter the composition of an image. Although many people may not be aware of the term “rule of thirds,” they may very well apply it on a daily basis when taking pictures with their mobile devices. Digital cameras and camera apps normally have a RoT grid option to assist the user in taking a photograph. Most photo editing software also provide a RoT layer to guide the cropping process of a picture. Virtually any book on learning photography will discuss the RoT. One of the goals of employing the RoT is to compose an aesthetically pleasing and balanced image composition but also to position the most important information within the image in such a way as to communicate it saliently, thereby increasing the probability of a more accurate identification
    of the most important information of an image. 
    
    The RoT as a guiding principle of image composition and image perception
    is especially relevant in the digital news media environment, with its increasing emphasis on visual culture. Visual news has been predicted to be replacing text-based news as the main source of information. Photos and videos are and continue to be important in the online communication economy on social media as well as in political communication and participation. In fact, news consumers increasingly share and consume visual information. For instance, over the past few years, the consumption of online news videos alone doubled across several countries in the Americas and Europe.
    
    The proliferation of visual information has a number of implications for the production and perception of visual news content. On the one hand, the demand for images as an essential tool for journalistic storytelling created a demand for multimedia skills to produce professional high-quality visual content. Students in video and photography classes, including in the U.S., 
    where this study was conducted, learn using RoT in order to improve the composition of an image (while abiding by journalistic principles and ethics). Possessing such a skill has been deemed to be one of the differences between visual content produced by professional journalists and amateurs.
    
On the other hand, a shift toward more visual content may impact the way users, readers, and audiences perceive information and news. Scholars speak of a visual primacy effect that highlights the salience of visual cues over verbal ones. Empirical research shows that visual cues can overshadow textual information or carry biases such as in political news coverage, environmental news, conflict coverage, but also on social media. People have the tendency—at least on Facebook—to form impressions about others primarily based on their profile photos, rather than on the verbal self-disclosures that accompany these images.
    
    The proliferation of visual information and the dominance of visual over textual information, as described by the visual primacy effect, indicate the need to improve the creation of visual information such as photographs. The RoT may be able to assist in this process by making the focus point of an image more salient and thus reducing the probability of information processing errors. Yet, despite the ubiquity of visual content and wide use of the RoT as a decision-making tool for composition, research has not expansively explored the effectiveness of the RoT as a way to guide attention within visual communication. This exploratory study attempts to fill this gap in research by theorizing and testing the RoT as a geometrical structure that assists the processing of visual information.
    
    Literature Review
    The Rule of Thirds: Practice and Theory
    Since the fifteenth century, artists have been using the Rule of Thirds (RoT) to make certain crucial parts of an image more salient. Specifically, the RoT is used to determine areas of interest that lie at the four intersections of imaginary lines drawn to divide the composition into thirds, both horizontally and vertically.
    
    Many visual artists and photo professionals maintain that composition rules guide attention effectively and produce desired effects in most circumstances. The main subject is often placed off-center, at one of the intersections of the thirds, to avoid static effects. The RoT helps balance and structure the different elements of an image by establishing visual priorities among lines, shapes, colors, and textures, and it helps orchestrate viewer eye movement, encouraging exploration of the entire photograph.
    
    Although users of the RoT frequently accept these principles, little research has been done to test them. Some scholars suggest that artistic practices have merit and can serve as a good starting point for exploratory research. They argue that artists often recognize key visual principles before psychologists, acknowledging that the visual image results from the observer’s active perceptual activity.
    
Evidence shows that artistic rules can produce measurable effects. For instance, using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), one study found that the golden ratio produced the “desired effects.” Subjects exposed to a Greek statue in its original canonical form experienced strong feelings of beauty, while subjects viewing the same sculpture with altered proportions rated it as ugly, with the fMRI results supporting these subjective evaluations.
    Despite the RoT’s widespread use, relatively little research has explored its effects. Some studies have shown that the centrality of an image produces higher emotional intensity and valence, though they didn’t directly test if RoT composition or geometrical alignment produces such effects. Other research examined the detection of RoT presence as a marker of image aesthetics, quality, and object salience. Computer models have been found to approximate human perceptions of RoT images, though some studies suggest RoT may only play a minor role in aesthetic evaluations.
    
    Few studies have convincingly theorized why RoT may be an effective compositional rule or shown clear connections to human perceptions. Little research has tested whether RoT assists in human information processing by making central information more salient.
    
    This study argues that RoT composition will guide attention and ease the processing of primary visual content. Specifically, the RoT raises attention to the main subject, conveys crucial information through positioning, and enhances engagement through a higher perceived valence. In this way, RoT reduces the complexity of visual information by placing content within a geometrical structure that aligns with the human visual system.
    
    Vision: A System to Reduce Complexity
    The human visual system enables us to see, comprehend, and make sense of our surroundings. It is considered more effective and faster at processing audio-visual than verbal information. The visual system can stimulate behavior before the conscious mind becomes aware of it, and it is superior in processing complex information quickly. One glance at a complex visual scene can convey more information than words would, with greater fidelity. Research indicates that the visual system evolved as a tool for managing information and social complexity, supporting higher-order thinking and processing nuanced social information.
    
Although the visual system can handle complex sets of information, the absence of explicit guidelines, like syntactical and lexical rules in visual communication, complicates the transfer of exact information through images and videos. Neuroscientists and psychologists have shown that human vision operates by reducing complexity. For example, perception theory builds on the idea that the eyes are a direct extension of the brain into the environment. Perception is a complex process, driven largely by the unconscious emotional system, which helps us derive meaning from what we see.
    
    Visual cognition suggests that behavior, learning, and knowledge are direct responses to visual input. This process allows us to recognize shapes, objects, and scenes based on retinal input. Research on visual cognition focuses on the recognition of shapes and surfaces and how they are remembered or recalled. Geometrical shapes, surfaces, and redundancy are key elements in easing and speeding up the processing of visual input, and aesthetics also play a role in memory retention, as “good” figures are more likely to be remembered than “poor” ones.
    
However, visual information processing can be complicated by certain factors. Eye movements, which occur every 200 milliseconds, limit the visual system’s ability to store information for long periods. Perception can also be influenced by forward or backward masking, where one visual stimulus interferes with another. Additionally, emotions can bias visual perception. Given these cognitive limitations, a selection process must focus on the most crucial visual information for effective vision. Research shows that geometrical structures, such as those found in the Rule of Thirds (RoT) grid, can assist in this selection process by aligning content and guiding attention.
    
    Attention, a Guiding Principle for Vision
    Researchers describe attention as a type of selection process distinguishing relevant from irrelevant stimuli, which is required to process visual information. Tipper and Weaver suggest that the visual system relies on attention; without it, objects cannot be processed, nor recognized. Pylyshyn stresses the importance of the “focal attention as an interface between vision and cognition.” Attention, in other words, enhances specific spatial points or areas, which define or constitute particular objects. Specifically, attention heightens but also diminishes aspects of perception. Thus, attention operates like a filtering system that includes and excludes visual categories from the focus of awareness. Pylyshyn argues that the filtering process exists to prevent overloading of the visual system and to reduce interference on perception and cognition.
    
    Several researchers have suggested that attention is guided by specific patterns and symmetries of geometrical shapes that facilitate information processing. Uttal posits that “human visual systems are symmetry information-processing systems.” In other words, specific layouts of a scene or surface representations, that highlight the edges of surfaces, induce attention, making perception possible. Pylyshyn describes visual analysis or vision as
    “a highly complex informationprocessing system [that] individuates, or picks out, objects in a scene and computes the spatial layout of visible surfaces and the 3D shapes of the objects in the scene.”
    
    Marr conceptualizes the complexity of the visual process and cognition by defining vision from the user-centered perspective. His model, which converges the concepts of vision, attention and an even-spaced grid, specifically evokes the idea that the RoT may mimic the function of the human visual system on a rudimentary level. Marr describes vision as “a process that produces from images of the external world a description that is useful to the viewer and not cluttered with irrelevant information.” Marr’s model stresses that the filtering of information is achieved through geometrical structures that raise attention and accelerate the processing of the filtered visual information. Marr speaks of three different levels of analysis within the visual process, which all utilize geometrical structures akin to a coordinate system or a grid. The “primal sketch” provides important information about the two-dimensional sphere by detecting intensity changes and a geometrical distribution. The “2 ½-D sketch” highlights spatial relationships within a viewer centered coordinate frame. The last stage is the “3-D model representation” which changes the frame to an object centered coordinate frame to “describe shapes and their spatial organization.”
    
    While scholars point out that perception is not governed by specific laws, they agree on an underlying mechanism of attention, i.e., filtering visual information on the basis of geometrical structures that are spatially aligned. Attention can then be described as a process, which is guided by symmetry and geometrical structures that assist in the filtering of information and contribute to the ease of information processing within the complexity of visual cognition. The idea of the RoT as a geometrical structure that guides attention may then have merit. As a compositional tool RoT assists human vision by placing visual content on a grid, guiding the observer’s attention toward the most crucial visual information of an image. Thus, allowing for an easier, faster and less error prone processing of visual content. Following the rationale of these theoretical underpinnings, images that follow the RoT should make the focus of interest more accessible and easier to be understood. Thus, also making, among other aspects, the message and valence of an image more salient. Research shows that attention is closely connected to valence, which has been described as a form of cognition. Valence perceptions can thus be considered as an expression of information processing, reflecting a level of attention or how salient the main message of an image may be. We posit that measuring and comparing valence perceptions of images that are compliant and noncompliant with the RoT can thus indicate how the RoT aides image information processing.
    
  In summary, on the basis of these theoretical propositions, we posit that the RoT manipulates the visual structure of an image to raise attention, facilitating an easier visual analysis and understanding of a photograph. In order to examine this proposition, this study explores two research questions, which were deemed appropriate for this first-time research inquiry synthesizing and exploring these concepts. First, research has often argued that one of the critical aspects of understanding the narrative of an image is to perceive the valence (positive or negative) of the image as a form of information processing. Therefore, we explore whether ratings of the perceived valence of images are significantly affected by the compliance with the RoT.
    
    RQ1. Does the rule of thirds have a significant effect on the perceived valence of images?
    
    Another important aspect of image production is to place the main subject or focus of interest in such a way that it draws attention to the central information conveyed by the image. The literature on vision suggests that the RoT would help raise attention to the main subject of an image, which is arguably the starting point for perceiving the main information or narrative of an image. Thus, we sought to explore the 
    relationship between the perceived main subject of the image and compliance with the RoT.
    
    RQ2. Does the rule of thirds have a significant effect on the perceived main subject of images?
    
    Methodology
    Design
    In this experimental exploratory study, we employed a within-subjects 2 (valence type) × 2 (rule of thirds composition) × 2 (rule of thirds main subject) repeated-measures design. “Valence type” refers to the positive or negative (two levels) types of emotions of an image; “rule of thirds composition” indicates whether an image composition was in compliance with the RoT (two levels: “yes” and “no”); and the “rule of thirds main subject” referred to whether the main subject of the image was situated on one of the four RoT grid intersections (two levels: “yes” and “no”).
    
    Employing the repeated-measures design to test “perceived valence” and “perceived main subject of image” ensured stronger statistical power while also being economical, requiring fewer participants. The repeated measures design also made sense as the level of variability between participants across all images (that contain different characteristics of the independent variables) was low and the design allowed for a higher number of respondents to produce a given number of observations in contrast to other experimental designs that only match participants to one image or independent variable. Thus, due to the nature of the within-subjects experiment design the sample size was deemed appropriate. The 41 participants completing the study were each exposed to 24 different news images in random order (see below), making the total n = 984 for the experiment. For this research design, power analysis indicated that a total sample of 34 participants would be needed to detect large effects (d = .8) with 90% power using a t-test (with alpha at .05).
    
    Sample Population
    A total of 52 undergraduate students majoring in journalism were recruited from a large mid-Atlantic university in the United States via in-class announcements. Participants were told they would view images and answer a short set of questions for each image. In the recruitment phase, participants were also informed of the potentially graphic nature of some images based on the topics being portrayed and were given the option to decline participation. Under the instructors’ discretion, students who participated in the study received extra credit, or if choosing not to participate in the study, students were provided with an opportunity to complete a separate assignment for the same credit. Of the 52 students surveyed, 41, aged 19–25, completed the survey. Twenty-four participants were female (58.6%) and seventeen were male (41.4%).
    
    Material
    Twenty-four news images across six news topics were selected for this study. The six news topics were determined by surveying 25 university students in a pretest where they discussed perceived controversy levels of 20 news topics. The perceived controversial nature of the images was an important element for this study because we sought to understand how the respondents would perceive the valence (positive or negative) of the image differently based on various RoT conditions. In other words, we postulated that depicting controversial topics (pro vs con perspectives) would result in a distinct valence structure (positive or negative emotions). The following six topics received the most responses in the pretest, which we then selected for this study: drinking (healthy lifestyle vs binge drinking), gay marriage (pro vs con), Greek life (brother/sisterhood vs hazing), football (glory of sport vs injuries), U.S. troops abroad (fighting for our country vs mistreating prisoners), and President (pro vs con).
    
    Four news images for each news topic were selected using a Google image search of each topic followed by each word in parentheses above (e.g., “Greek life brotherhood/sisterhood” and “Greek life hazing”). Two images per story and per aspect (i.e., two positive/two negative) were selected randomly from the search results. The image orientation was not a factor in selection of photos for this study but the majority of images were horizontal while only two were vertical. The general Google image search was used deliberately to reflect the generic exposure to news images online. For the purpose of this experiment, we aimed to control perceived valence type by selecting images for all topics that tended in one valence direction (either positive or negative). For instance, negative images about gay marriage depicted only anti-gay marriage protesters holding disparaging signs and positive images depicted only happy (smiling) just-married gay couples. By the same token positive military images only showed smiling soldiers and negative images depicted scenes of a wounded soldier or abuse of a prisoner by a soldier. Using a wide range of topics allowed us to control for possible individual biases regarding a specific topic.
    
    In order to further ensure that our selection of images portray a valence direction (positive or negative) we conducted a manipulation check of the stimuli material. Ten photojournalism experts with expertise in both still photography and videography (professional photographers—including photojournalists at CNN, the White House Press Corps and the Baltimore Sun,—university educators or both) examined the selected images for compliance with the RoT. The experts also rated and determined the valence (as either positive or negative) of each image. Their comments about each image determined the main subject of each image, and the levels for each independent variable (“rule of thirds composition,” “rule of thirds main subject”), which was essential for coding the experiment survey data. In sum, we operationalized the experts’ opinion as the accurate understanding of the main subject, composition and the intended valence of each image (positive/negative).
    
Respondents’ answers were then coded as either “congruent with experts” opinion or “not congruent with experts” opinion. As a result, 15 out of the 24 images were identified as complying with the RoT in terms of composition, and 14 images as having main subjects complying with the RoT. In summary, out of 984 total cases, there were 492 per valence type (positive, negative); 615 following the RoT in terms of image composition; and 574 with the main subject following the RoT.
    
    Procedure
    Participants received a link to an online survey hosted by Qualtrics software. Upon activating the link, participants received brief instructions concerning the procedures and the option to withdraw at any time from the experiment. Then each of the 41 participants was shown the stimulus material (24 images) one image at a time, equaling 984 image views in total. In order to avoid potential carry over effects arising from the order of images shown, we randomized the image sequence for each participant. 
    
    After exposure to each image, participants had to fill out a three-question survey. The first question asked about the perceived valence of the image or how it made participants feel, using a 1–9 Likert scale (1 being “extremely negative” and 9 being “extremely positive”). The second and third questions asked participants to write down what they perceived as the main subject of the image and what they thought the story was, as could be told from the image. In the online survey, participants were not able to navigate back and forth from image to image. Participants took, on average, 42 minutes to complete the experiment. The completion time ranged from 23 to 57 minutes.
    
    Results
    Rule of Thirds and Perceived Valence
    In order to address the first research question—Does the rule of thirds have a significant effect on the perceived valence of images?—we tested whether participants perceived the direction of valence for an image 
    
    o each image’s predetermined valence (positive or negative). A one way ANOVA with mean values for perceived valence ratings for each image valence type (positive n1= 492; negative n2= 492) found that valence type of the image was a significant factor for the respondents’ perceived valence and its direction. Participants’ responses were highly skewed toward each end of the scale (1 and 9) in the direction of the predetermined (positive and negative) valence (M1= 6.82, SD= 1.38, M2= 3.09, SD= 1.66, F(1, 982) = 1473.80, p < .001).
    
    The distribution of images with a positive and negative valence in respect to RoT composition and main subject is not fully balanced. This imbalance is due to the Google search that we conducted, which aimed to reflect a wide variety of images, as they are found online. We took the conservative approach and tested if the unequal distribution may skew the valence perception. We ran several independent sample t-tests to examine if equality of variances is met. The Levene’s tests for equality of variances were not statistically significant indicating that the different groups’ variances are similar. Thus, the group size differences did not impact the analysis. Perceived valence scores were more negative when a negative valence image complied with the “rule of thirds composition” (M= 2.69, SD= 1.54) then if it did not (M= 4.27. SD= 1.45), t(490) = 9.98, p < .001, d = 1.05. A t-test between the positive valence groups also showed that participants perceived valence stronger when images complied with the rule n = 246 (M= 7.32, SD= 1.26) than if they did not n = 246 (M= 6.33, SD= 1.31), t(490) = 8.59, p < .001, d = .75.
    
    A t-test was also conducted to test the unequal group sizes for main subject RoT compliance and valence. Participants perceived higher positive valence when images complied with the RoT in respect to the main subject position n= 287 (M= 7.13, SD= 1.36) than when images did not have a main subject placed in the RoT grid n= 205 (M= 6.39, SD= 1.29), t(490) = 6.1, p < .001, d= .56. Another t-test confirmed the overall tendency that compliance with the RoT evokes stronger directional valence perceptions. Participants perceived images more negatively when the main subject was positioned in the RoT grid (M = 2.61, SD = 1.44) than if it wasn’t (M = 3.75, SD = 1.73), t(389) = 7.67, p < .001, 
    d = .71.
    
We also ran a number of ANOVAs to compare valence perceptions (positive and negative) in respect to the presence of the rules of thirds (i.e., RoT compliance/non-compliance) and whether the main subject was positioned in the RoT grid or not. All of the ANOVAs supported the t-test results. First, we compared positive valence perceptions of images compliant with the RoT with images that were non-compliant. Again, the presence of RoT composition showed that participants perceived an image as more positive (M1) than without RoT (M2) composition (M1= 7.32, SD= 1.26, M2= 6.33, SD= 1.31, F(1, 491) = 73.84, p < .001). We then repeated this step by comparing whether negative valence perceptions followed a similar pattern. Again, when images were compliant with the RoT, negative valence perception was more pronounced (M1) than without RoT (M2) compliance (M1= 2.69, SD= 1.54, M2= 4.27, SD= 1.45, F(1, 491) = 99.61, p < .001).
    
    Next, we examined if the valence perceptions were affected by the presence of the main subject (MS) in the RoT grid. Both the positive valence (M1= 7.13, SD= 1.36, M2= 6.39, SD= 1.29, F(1, 491) = 37.28, p < .001) and the negative valence (MS on RoT grid M1= 2.61, SD= 1.44, MS not on RoT grid M2= 3.75, SD= 1.73, F(1, 491) = 62.44, p < .001) were significantly more pronounced when the main subject was positioned on RoT grid than not.
    
    In order to see if the previous tendencies are robust, we further examined whether there were significant differences in the overall perceived valence ratings of the images (positive and negative combined) across the two RoT characteristics (composition, main subject). A two-way ANOVA was conducted to compare means of perceived valence for the two types of RoT characteristics. When RoT was followed for composition (n = 615), the average perceived valence rating was 4.59 (SD= 2.71), and 4.34 (SD= 2.57) when it was not (n= 369), showing a significantly different rating when the RoT for composition was followed, F(1, 983) = 64.87, p < .001. Similarly, RoT for the main subject was also a significant factor for differences in the overall perceived valence ratings. Compliance to RoT for main subject (n = 574) showed a mean of 6.59 (SD= 1.36) and non-compliance a mean of 5.37 (SD= 1.65). Differences were significant, F(1, 983) = 15.39, p < .001. We further examined the valence and RoT compliance by analyzing each type of RoT compliance. Differences in mean perceived valence were significantly higher when the RoT was not followed in terms of composition, but followed in terms of main subject (F(1, 983) = 6.55, p < .05). In other words, placing the main subject on the RoT grid proved to be
    a more significant indicator for differences in valence perception.
    
    Rule of Thirds and Identification 
    of Main Subject
    ANCOVA showed that only the RoT in terms of main subject was a significant factor for congruency of main subject identification. When the RoT was present for main subject (n= 573), the mean score for congruency was .59 (SD= .49) and when it was not present (n= 411), the mean score was significantly lower at .50 (SD= .50), F(1,
    983) = 11.43, p < .01. 
    
    Also, significant interactions were found for each type of RoT compliance. Differences of congruency between predetemined (expert based) main subject identification and respondents were significantly higher when the RoT was not followed in terms of composition, but followed in terms of main subject (F(1, 983) = 54.70, p < .001). Thus, the RoT
    compliance with regard to main subject yielded higher scores, making it easier for participants to identify the main subject . 
    
    Conclusion and Discussion
    This exploratory study took a first step to test possible effects of the RoT on participants’ perceptions of news images. We tested whether the RoT would make the main subject and the valence of a news photograph more salient. Our data analysis provides a tentative but promising indication that the RoT may be more than simply an aesthetical compositional tool; it appears to also assist in the information processing of visual stimuli. The results for both of our research questions—that explored whether the RoT has a significant effect on valence and main subject perception—suggest that participants’ perceptions were indeed guided by the RoT grid as they processed the visual information more accurately. The perceived valence of images was significantly higher when those images followed the RoT in their composition than when they didn’t. The differences for perceived valence were also higher when the main subject was positioned in the intersections of the RoT grid, than if it was not. This means that valence perception was stronger (more vivid) for images with the main subject complying with the RoT. In other words, participants were better able to correctly recognize the most important part of an image and as such an integral part of the narrative of the image.
    
    The RoT also aided the identification of the main subject. Our analysis of covariance showed that participants were more likely than not to identify the main subject when it was located in the RoT grid. The interaction effects that we found also pointed towards the importance of placing the main subject on the RoT grid. Valence was higher when the main subject was located on the RoT grid than when an image merely followed a “rule of thirds composition.” This indicates that the RoT could have significant effects in conveying the story of a picture more forcefully, making it more salient and easier to process.
    
    These findings are promising indicators that the RoT may ease information processing and as such has the potential to minimize possible errors in visual communication. Specifically, our findings suggest that the RoT could help avoid misidentifications of the main subject. The geometrical structures guide the process of vision by raising attention toward the focus of interest of an image, thereby filtering out irrelevant information. The process of visual cognition is guided by attention, which in turn is primarily triggered by the recognition of geometrical shapes and surfaces, symmetry, and spatial relationships. We argue that a similar process appears to facilitate the effectiveness of the RoT in establishing “visual priorities.”
    
    The significance of our results emphasizes the importance of the RoT for journalistic storytelling—not merely to raise attention, but also to effectively convey the focus point of an image. Images complying with the RoT can be considered more efficient in pointing toward relevant news content. But more specifically, when photojournalists have to choose between overall image composition or placing the main subject on to the RoT grid, they should favor the latter over the former to most effectively communicate visual content. The need to clearly communicate visual content is getting increasingly important as the consumption of visual news content continues to grow. Findings also indicate that in particular controversial news concerning social, political, or environmental issues would benefit from employing the RoT to emphasize the valence of an image, as increasing the emotional and/or affective salience of an image can facilitate greater engagement with the visual content.
    
Limitations and Prospects for Future Research
    Even though our study shows significant effects, there are a number of limitations that need to be addressed to move research on the RoT forward. First of all, there are no clear guidelines about the use and implementation of the RoT. This makes it very challenging to assess images, and even experienced 
    photojournalists and experts often disagree on whether a particular photo follows the rule or not. This also created some problems in our study since we designed our project to reflect the everyday news photo consumption experience online. The Google Image search did not provide us with an equal number of images that followed the RoT and those that did not comply with the compositional guideline. In a follow-up study, it would seem prudent to implement a series of tests 
    by using images that unmistakably abide by the RoT or to possibly use a machine vision analysis to help detect the presence of the RoT. At the same time, it would be greatly beneficial to control for other aspects of an image such as color, contrast, brightness, depth of field, object size, image orientation (vertical vs horizontal), and so on to clearly parse out the impact of the RoT on information processing and main information detection of an image. Such examinations would also allow us to investigate the perception of overall news photography quality in relation to the presence and absence of the RoT in order to tease out possible aesthetical effects.
    
    Moreover, our conceptualization of valence has some limitations because not all individuals may follow normative valence perceptions. In other words, some may evaluate distraught faces, abuse, or anger as positive rather than negative. Thus, our study cannot claim to universally describe, measure, or predict valence. In future studies, it would also be worthwhile to expand the research, using a larger population sample, and to test and control for political partisanship, attitudes, or other biases that may be influencing participants’ perceptions of controversial topics. The fact that we used an online experimental setting may also have influenced our findings, and it may be worthwhile to conduct a similar study in a more controlled environment. This study is just a first step in looking more closely at the significance of the RoT in conveying relevant information within journalistic storytelling. Much more needs to be done to understand this compositional rule and its effects on visual cognition, especially as images are becoming increasingly pivotal in the selection of news content and influential in the understanding of news.

    Evaluating the Rule of Thirds in Photographs 
    and Paintings <br><br>
    Seyed Ali Amirshahi , Gregor Uwe Hayn-Leichsenring, Joachim Denzler, and Christoph Redies<br><br>
    
    In 1797, John Thomas Smith proclaimed that the rule of thirds represents a more harmonizing proportion to follow in paintings of rural scenery than any other proportion. Ever since, the rule of thirds has been referred to as an important principle governing the spatial composition of aesthetic images. Although different descriptions have been given for the rule of thirds, most if not all of them suggest that, in order to create a photograph or painting of high aesthetic quality, the main object or focus point should be placed along one of the two imaginary horizontal or the two imaginary vertical lines that divide the image into nine equal parts (the third lines). For example, in his treatise, Smith advocated to fill the painting area by “two thirds of one element (as of water) to one third of another element (as of land),” rather than placing their border in the center of the painting.
    
    According to art critics and experts in photography, the rule of thirds is one of the most important composition rules used in painting and photography. In one version of the rule of thirds, the focus point in an image is placed along one of the third lines. In another version, the focus point is placed on one of the four intersections of the third lines. Photographs that follow the rule of thirds show the main focus point or object on or near the third lines or on their intersections. Photographs that do not follow the rule of thirds are also evident in contrast.
    
Others, for example, Arnheim in his study of compositional balance in images 
    of simple geometric forms, stressed the perceptual importance of the center of the image and the objects that it contains. Tyler reported a general tendency in art portraits that one of the eyes of the person depicted is centered along the midline in rectangular paintings. However, other researchers have found no evidence for such a bias. Palmer et al. reviewed some of the discrepancies between the on-center and off-center theories. They conducted a series of psychological experiments that confirmed the on-center bias, but only for forward-facing symmetrical objects; left-facing and right-facing objects tended to be located off-center. For vertically positioned objects, people preferred positions in the image that reflected spatial asymmetries in their functional properties and the typical position of the object relative to the observer. Moreover, Leyssen demonstrated that semantics plays a role in images containing two meaningful objects. Observers preferred images in which semantically related objects were close together and unrelated objects were far apart. McManus extended this type of investigation to other major axes in the rectangular frame of photographs. They critically evaluated Arnheim’s theory of visual balance and found no evidence to support it. Nevertheless, this and a previous study by the authors demonstrated that there are reproducible rules, according to which naive participants and experts reach aesthetic judgments on photographs.
    
    Some recent psychological studies provided precise physical definitions for concepts such as balance in images and investigated large numbers of images, but some of the earlier studies were less clear on how they measure image properties, or they based their results on a rather limited number of images. In the field of computational aesthetics, well-defined local and global physical properties were measured in large sets of images by modern digital image processing tools. However, the computational studies focused largely on simple, low-level features that can hardly explain the variability of aesthetic responses amongst humans or top-down cognitive processes involved in aesthetic judgments. Also, claims in computational aesthetics that the statistical properties relate to perceptual phenomena were sometimes not supported by data from rigorous psychological experiments. Therefore, a combination of both approaches is warranted to study the 
    
    determinants of individual preference.
    In computational aesthetics, an increasing amount of studies on the quality assessment of images and videos was published in the last few years. Recently, there has been a shift of interest towards the aesthetic quality assessment of paintings and photographs. Extracting multiple features from paintings and
    photographs is one of the common approaches taken in computational aesthetics. Most metrics share common features, for example, exposure of light, colorfulness, saturation, hue, aspect ratio, shape convexity, etc. Interestingly, the rule-of-thirds feature is amongst the features commonly used to assess the composition in paintings and photographs. For example, Datta et al. (2006) extracted 56 features and Li and Chen (2009)
    extracted 40 features from the image and used these features in their pooling  system system to come up with a score to assess the aesthetic quality of photographs and paintings based on subjective high-quality or low-quality ratings. In both metrics, the rule of thirds is used as a feature. An aspect common to both metrics is that the computations are restricted to the central window outlined by the third lines. The reasoning behind this selection was that objects positioned on one of the third lines tend to stretch toward the central point, and observers tend to focus on the center part of the painting.
    
    Mai and collaborators developed a computer-assisted method to predict whether a photograph respects the rule of thirds or not. They based their method on maps of saliency for each image. Saliency maps highlight image regions that are different from their surroundings and are calculated with the aim of predicting average looking behavior. Mai built a classifier that achieved around 80% accuracy in automatically detecting the rule of thirds in a photograph. Similar or related methods have been used in unsupervised cropping methods for digital photography. However, at present, the computer-based approaches cannot take into account semantic meaning, which also contributes to the appearance of image content as salient for human observers. Such top-down processing has an effect on looking behavior and, consequently, on the subjective assessment of whether an image obeys the rule of thirds.
    
There are many different ways of defining what may stick out in an image, and, consequently, there are many metrics to calculate saliency maps. In a recent survey of 35 such methods, researchers systematically studied their accuracy in predicting eye movements. Accuracy varied greatly between the different methods, depending on how accuracy was defined and the perceptual task involved (e.g., looking at synthetic versus natural images), but some methods consistently performed better than others. In the realm of art, eye movements were recorded in participants who viewed paintings from different Western art periods and compared the fixation maps with two different types of saliency maps. They found a high, but not perfect correlation between the saliency maps and the behavioral data. Similar results were obtained with a dataset of abstract and figurative paintings, and it was observed that the effect of saliency on eye fixations is short-lived.
    
    In the study by Mai, the authors did not correlate the performance of their automatic rule-of-thirds (ROT) classifier with subjective ROT ratings. It also remained unclear whether the photographs that followed the rule of thirds were perceived as more aesthetic. These issues will be addressed in the present study by comparing computed ROT values and subjective ROT rating scores. We also propose an algorithm that calculates ROT values in real-time without the need of training a classifier. 
    Three different methods for computing saliency were compared. As controls, we studied two additional datasets that do not follow the rule of thirds. Finally, we studied photographs that were rated as highly aesthetic by the users of a web-based photography forum, and artworks of Western provenance. We asked the following questions:
    
    (1) How well do the calculated ROT values correlate with subjective ROT scores?
    
    (2) How high are calculated ROT values for high-quality photographs and artists’ paintings of Western provenance? Do paintings differ in their values, depending on the content that is depicted in the paintings (abstract art, portraits, natural scenes or complex scenes with persons)?
    
    (3) Are photographs that follow the rule of thirds perceived as more aesthetic than those that do not?
    
    Material and Methods
    Image Datasets Used
    We used five different image datasets in our experiments to assess the performance of the proposed metrics and for evaluating the rule of thirds in paintings and photographs. Sample images from each image category are shown in Fig. 2.
    
    Rule-of-Thirds Photographs
This dataset consists of 679 photographs, which were randomly selected from a dataset of 2089 photographs that follow the rule of thirds and were collected by Mai. As a control, we randomly selected 403 photographs from a dataset of images by the same 
    authors that do not follow the rule of thirds. However, images were selected so that the mean values for the two groups matched approximately in terms of self-similarity, complexity, and anisotropy. Both types of images were gathered from the photo-sharing websites Flickr and Photo.net. Selection was based on the question of whether they did or did not follow the rule of thirds; whether the images were aesthetic or not, did not play a role in their selection, especially in the case of the photographs downloaded from the Flickr website. The two datasets do not share any images with the dataset.
    
    Photographs Taken Almost Randomly
    As another control, we analyzed a dataset of 606 photographs kindly provided by Prof. Chris McManus, University College, London. Image size was 2048 × 1536 pixels. The photographs were taken with a Canon Ixus 82 IS digital camera while the photographer was walking down streets or parks, sitting on buses or trains, in buildings, or other locations. The photographer made an explicit attempt to avoid pointing the camera at objects. Moreover, where possible, photographs were sampled at a regular interval to avoid a selection bias for particular objects or scenes. As a result, the photographs are examples of images that do not follow the rule of thirds. Sample photographs from the dataset are shown in Fig. 2k–o.
    
    Photographs of Simple Scenes of Objects
    This dataset consists of 200 photographs of simple (non-complex) scenes with one or only a few household and laboratory objects. The images were taken using a 15.1-megapixel digital camera (EOS 500D with EF-85 mm f/3.5–5.6 IS USM lens; Canon, Tokyo, Japan), as described previously. The main focus points of the images were the objects shown; the rule of thirds or other aesthetic criteria were not intentionally followed. Figure 2p–t represents sample images from this dataset. This database is available for public use through the website of our research group.
    
    High-Quality Photographs (Photo.net)
    This dataset consists of 200 photographs downloaded from the photo-sharing website Photo.net. The images were randomly selected from photographs that have an aesthetic rating of more than 5.5 out of a scale of 1 to 7. The ratings were given by the members of the website, that is, they were peer-reviewed by professional and amateur photographers. 
    
    Paintings
    This dataset consists of 727 paintings and comprises artworks of around 200 Western painters from a wide range of different centuries and a large variety of diverse art styles. The paintings were produced by well-known artists and collected by prestigious museums. The paintings were scanned from high-quality art books by our group using a calibrated digital scanner (Perfection 3200 Photo, Epson). To test whether the subject matter depicted in the paintings had an effect on the calculated ROT values, we classified the majority of the paintings based on their content. To reach reliable results, four categories of subject matter that contained large numbers of paintings were selected from the dataset. The categories were: abstract artworks (188 paintings), natural scenes (54 paintings), complex scenes with persons (151 paintings), and portraits (191 paintings).
    
Image Calculations
    Computational methods to study whether image composition complies with the rule of thirds have been proposed previously. As examples, we mentioned the studies by Datta and Li and Chen in the Introduction section. In the two studies, rule-of-thirds-related features are used as an input value in a pooling system that is designed to evaluate the aesthetic quality of a painting or photograph. By themselves, these features cannot predict the overall aesthetic quality of an artwork.
    
    Mai calculated different features based on saliency maps and used them in a classifier to determine whether an image followed the rule of thirds or not. Saliency maps have been used in different image and video quality metrics as well as in the field of computational aesthetics. Extending the work by Mai and colleagues, we propose a simple, robust, and fast method to assess the rule of thirds. Unlike the previous approach, which is a supervised method, our method is unsupervised and does not require prior training of a classifier.
    
    Over the last few years, a number of different ways to calculate visual saliency maps have been proposed. In the present work, we employ three well-established metrics, which we refer to as the frequency-tuned (FT) method, the ITTI method, and the graph-based visual saliency (GBVS) method. In the FT method, the distance between the Lab pixel vector in a Gaussian-filtered image and the mean Lab vector for the image is calculated. The ITTI method is based on the use of the Gaussian blur filter. This filter is applied to the image in a pyramid manner and the difference between the original image and level 4 of the pyramid is calculated. The GBVS method takes the same approach as the ITTI method, but the calculations are done at higher levels.
    
    In the proposed approach, we first calculated the saliency map for each image. The previous methods by Datta and Li and Chen were based on calculating mean values over a central region in the original image in separate color channels in the HSV and HSL color space. In the present study, we determined the maximum sum of saliency over four different regions that were related to the rule of thirds. Two approaches for selecting the regions of interest were followed. In the first approach, we used four boxes that were each centered on one of the intersections of the third lines  as the regions of interest. In the second approach, we introduced four stripes that were each centered on one of the third lines. The stripes and the boxes had a width and height that corresponded to 10%, 16% or 20% of the width and height of the image, respectively. Next, we calculated the mean saliency value for each of the four regions and then took the maximum value as a measure for the saliency placed on the third lines. For details of the calculations, see the Supplementary Appendix.
    
    Initially, we calculated stripes and boxes with different widths for all three saliency methods (FT, ITTI and GBVS). Because the GBVS method with boxes of a 16% width gave the best correlations with subjective ratings of the degree to which an image followed the rule of thirds, this combination of parameters was used for the rest of the study.
    
    To investigate whether saliency maps can be used to evaluate the existence of the rule of thirds, we measured the mean saliency over all images in each dataset introduced above. For each image, saliency maps were normalized to sum up to 1. To calculate the mean saliency map for each image category, we first resized each image in the category to 1024 × 1024 pixels so that the saliency maps of all images could be added to one another on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The result was then divided by the number of images in each category.
    
 Rating Experiments
    Participants
    Twenty participants between 19 and 41 years (mean age: 26.8 ± 5.9 SD, nine males) rated the aesthetics of presented images (Experiment 1). 
    Ten other participants between 22 and 33 years (mean age: 26.1 ± 3.4 SD, four males) estimated the degree to which the images followed the rule of thirds.
    
    Stimuli
    We used the dataset described in who separated the dataset into a subset of photographs that follow the rule of thirds, and a subset that does not obey the rule of thirds. From each subset, we randomly selected 100 images (200 images in total). The majority of photographs were color images, but grayscale images were also used. To achieve a consistent display on the screen, we reduced the size of all images to 800 pixels on the longer side. Smaller images were shown at their original size. In Experiment 2, we drew thin white lines on the images to indicate the third lines. All images were presented with a maximum size of 20.5 cm (longest side) on a computer 
    
    screen. Participants viewed stimuli from a distance of 90 cm (assured by a chin rest). Hence, images covered a maximum of 13° of the visual angle.
    
    Experiment 1: Rating of Aesthetic Appearance
    First, we showed ten example images for 2 s each to get the participants acquainted with the database. Then, participants were asked to rate the images according to their aesthetics on a mouse-based scale. The scale for the aesthetics rating was from 0 to 1 and continuous (100 steps, not visible to the participants) and endpoints were labeled with ‘not aesthetic’ and ‘aesthetic’, respectively (or the German equivalent to those terms). There was no time restriction. After response by clicking on the scale, the next image appeared. The 200 stimuli were presented separately and in random order on a black screen. Before each image appeared on the screen, the cursor of the mouse was 
    set to the midpoint of the scale.
    
    Experiment 2: Rating of the Presence of the Rule of Thirds
    First, we showed the participants three sample images. One of the images followed the rule of thirds based on the fact that the focus of interest was placed along one of the third lines. Another image followed the rule of thirds based on the fact that the focus of interest was on one of the intersections of the third lines. The third image did not follow the rule of thirds. In the experiment, ten example images were shown for 2 s to introduce the database. Then, participants were asked to evaluate by mouse click whether or not the focus point of the images was on one of the third lines or, in another round, on one of the four intersections of the third lines. The participants were asked to choose between the left (‘no’) and the right side (‘yes’) of a scale. They also had the option of selecting intermediate positions on the scale so that they could indicate the degree to which an image followed the rule of thirds. There was no time restriction. After the response, the next image appeared. The 200 stimuli were presented separately and in random order on the black screen. Five participants evaluated the third lines first and the other five participants evaluated the intersection points first.
    
 Subjective Rule-of-Thirds (ROT) Rating
    As a baseline for this study, we first asked ten participants to rate the degree to which 200 photographs followed the ROT. In separate sessions, participants evaluated two different ROT criteria that are commonly used. In one session, they assessed whether the focus of interest was on one of the third lines. In another session, they assessed whether the focus of interest was on one of the intersections of the third lines. For the rating, we selected 100 images that followed the ROT (here called ROT+ images) and 100 images that did not follow it (ROT− images) from the dataset.
    
    For the rating based on the intersections, the ROT+ photographs received an average score of 0.76 ± 0.17 SD on a continuous scale from 0 to 1. As expected, the average score of ROT− photographs was much lower (0.23 ± 0.22 SD; p < 0.0001, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test; Cohen’s d = 2.71). The corresponding scores for the rating based on the third lines were 0.62 ± 0.22 SD and 0.35 ± 0.23 SD, respectively (p < 0.0001; d = 1.21).
    
    Calculation of Saliency-Based ROT Measure
    Next, we calculated saliency-based ROT values for the three methods (GBVS, ITTI and FS) with different parameters and asked which paradigm yielded the highest correlations with the subjective ROT ratings. The same 200 photographs were used as described in Section 3.1. Results indicate that the highest correlations were obtained for the GBVS method with boxes of 16% width placed on the intersections of the third lines. For this metric, Fig. 3 shows a dot plot of the subjective ROT rating versus the calculated ROT measure. Largely confirming the initial classification, the majority of ROT− images (blue dots in Fig. 3) received not only low scores for subjective ROT ratings (see above) but also low values calculated for ROT (mean 0.069 ± 0.016 SD). 
    In contrast, the ROT values calculated for the ROT+ images (red squares in Fig. 3), which received high subjective ROT scores, scattered more widely at a much higher level (mean 0.109 ± 0.058 SD; p < 0.0001, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test; d = 0.94). While the subjective ROT scores did not correlate with the calculated ROT values for the ROT− images, we found a moderate correlation between the two measures for the ROT+ images (red regression line in Fig. 3).
    
    Because the GBVS metric resulted in the highest overall correlation between calculated ROT values and subjective ROT scores, we used this metric in the rest of the study. This choice was in agreement with a recent survey of 35 saliency metrics, in which the GBVS method outperformed most of the other methods in eye movement prediction accuracy.
    
    We also compared the subjective ROT scores with the ROT values that were calculated with the methods introduced by Datta and Li and Chen. However, no correlation was found. We conclude that the two metrics do not help us in distinguishing between images that follow or do not follow the rule of thirds in our dataset of images.
    In the majority of images, the 
    
    positions of high saliency values (yellow to red color) correspond to subjective focus points of interest.
     Confirming similar results, the average saliency map for the ROT+ images shows highest saliency values in the box that is centered on the lower right intersection of the third lines, but also relatively high values at the other intersections. By contrast, saliency is highest in the center of the ROT− photographs. A similar central peak of saliency is observed for the photographs of scenes taken almost randomly, the simple scenes of objects, and the high-quality photographs. For the entire painting dataset, there is a central tendency for high saliency values, but peak saliency is shifted slightly towards the upper left corner. A separate analysis for the different categories of paintings reveals that this shift is especially prominent in portraits. The position of this peak may relate to the tendency of artists to place the faces, which are highly salient, into the upper regions of the paintings where they are close to or covered by the third lines. Average saliency in the other categories of painting categories is more evenly distributed across the images.
    
    The above results were quantified by calculating the saliency values with the GBVS method (boxes overlying intersections, 16% width) for each image separately. The results confirm that the ROT+ images have higher mean saliency values (0.102 ± 0.053 SD) than the ROT− photographs (0.067 ± 0.016 SD); p < 0.001; d = 0.90) as well as all the other image categories (for all other comparisons, p < 0.001, Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison test; d = 0.73 to 1.73). Among the paintings, portraits have higher values (0.068 ± 0.016 SD) than abstract images (0.059 ± 0.018 SD; p < 0.001, d = 0.46) and complex scenes with persons (0.061 ± 0.013 SD; p < 0.001, d = 0.55).
    Subjective Rating of Beauty
    In the last part of this study, participants rated the aesthetics of the 100 ROT+ photographs and 100 ROT− photographs that had been previously assessed for the degree to which they complied with the rule of thirds. The mean aesthetic rating score for the ROT+ images (0.59 ± 0.14 SD) was slightly higher than that of the ROT− images (0.54 ± 0.14 SD; p < 0.01, two-tailed Mann–Whitney test, d = 0.36). Aesthetic rating scores were plotted as a function of the subjective ROT scores and the calculated ROT values. There was a weak overall correlation between the aesthetic rating score and the subjective ROT rating score (Spearman ρ = 0.17, p < 0.05). However, the aesthetic rating score did not correlate significantly with the calculated ROT measure.
    
    Discussion
    Computational versus Behavioral Measures for the Rule of Thirds
    We used three different saliency metrics to calculate two rule-of-third (ROT) measures and validated the results in comparison with subjective data from participants who rated the degree to which photographs followed the rule of thirds in a psychological experiment. Compared to the other methods, the GBVS metrics with boxes centered on the intersections of the third lines yielded the strongest correlations between the computed data and the subjective scores. The GBVS method was shown previously to be an outstanding metric to predict looking behavior in a comparative study of saliency methods.
    
    Overall, the correlation between computed ROT values and behavioral scores was of intermediate strength (Spearman ρ = 0.47). For photographs that did not follow the rule of thirds on subjective grounds (ROT− images), low calculated ROT values were obtained on average. The two control databases, which had not been generated to comply with the rule of thirds (almost random photographs and simple scenes of objects) also yielded low calculated ROT values. 
    By contrast, average calculated ROT values were much higher for photographs that were rated as concordant with the rule of thirds in the present study (ROT+ images). However, computed values scattered widely and the correlation with the subjective ROT scores was relatively weak (Spearman ρ = 0.31). Therefore, we conclude that factors other than saliency are likely to contribute to subjective ROT ratings. Presumably, top-down mechanisms that take the semantics of a photograph into account are amongst the most relevant factors. A similar combination of bottom-up (saliency-based) and top-down (cognitive) mechanisms has been invoked in the prediction of eye movements. In conclusion, we demonstrate that low-level visual saliency contributes to the perception of the rule of thirds in photographs in a bottom-up fashion.
    
    Strikingly, the mean saliency maps demonstrate that peak saliency in the rule-of-thirds (ROT+) photographs is not evenly distributed across the boxes overlying the four intersections of the third lines. Instead, they are concentrated in the lower left box. It remains to be investigated whether this observation is unique to the dataset analyzed in the present study, corresponds to a more general tendency by photographers, or reflects other compositional rules.
    
    The present results corroborate the study by Mai et al., which achieved 
    a 72–80% classification rate of photographs that followed the rule of thirds versus photographs that did not. However, unlike the study by Mai et al., the method proposed by us does not require any prior training of a classifier. It represents an automated tool that instantly delivers a single measure, which can contribute to the question of whether a photograph complies with the rule of thirds. As such, practicing artists or photographers may use this method in isolation during their work. A robust, fast and reliable method for measuring the ROT feature might be valuable also for research in the field of experimental aesthetics. 
    
    Correlation of Aesthetic Ratings with Rule-of-Thirds Judgments and Measures
    The rule of thirds is a feature that is widely used to assess the aesthetic quality of paintings and photographs. In the present study, we challenged the validity of this approach by relating aesthetic rating scores to ROT rating scores for a dataset of 200 photographs. The two scores correlated only weakly (Spearman ρ = 0.17). Moreover, there was no correlation between the aesthetic rating score and the calculated ROT measure. The mean calculated ROT values for aesthetic photographs were only slightly higher than those of control photographs that do not follow the rule of thirds. These results suggest that the rule of thirds plays only a minor, if any, role in the aesthetic evaluation of photographs.
    
    ROT Values Computed for Paintings
    Low calculated ROT values were also observed for the dataset of paintings. However, we did not obtain subjective rating scores for the aesthetic value of the paintings. Nevertheless, curators of prestigious art museums considered their acquisition worthwhile, probably because of the superior artistic quality of the paintings. Also, we did not rate the degree to which the paintings followed the rule of thirds. Nevertheless, the low calculated ROT values for paintings suggest that the rule of thirds, at least as far as it is based on saliency-based mechanisms, is not a decisive factor for determining the visual quality of the paintings.
    
    Mean saliency maps for portrait paintings showed a prominent peak close to the upper left box. This peak likely corresponds to the average position of the faces in portrait paintings. It results in relatively high saliency values close to the upper left ROT box and, consequently, leads to slightly higher calculated ROT values. Average saliency in the other categories of paintings is more evenly distributed and mean saliency values are about as low as in photographs that do not follow the rule of thirds.
    
    Conclusions
    In summary, our findings suggest that the rule of thirds might not be as important for the evaluation of the visual quality in photographs and artworks as previously assumed. Evidently, not following this rule does not necessarily result in images of low visual quality. We can only speculate why the rule of thirds plays such an important role in textbooks on photography and art. Perhaps, like the golden section, the rule of thirds mirrors the desire of artists and photographers to comprehend rules of artistic composition. Therefore, it might have become a normative aspect of creating artworks rather than a qualitative one. The rule of thirds may also help beginners to endow the products of their creativity with a particular visual structure under conscious control. Eventually, as artists gain intuitive expertise in artistic composition, they may drop the rule, which might be the reason why we did not find it in high-quality photographs and artworks.
